# The Archive as Project — the Poetics and Politics of the (Photo)Archive

<Author link="/chapter_22">Krzysztof Pijarski</Author>

This project is an attempt at rethinking the archive in a post-socialist Central and Eastern Europe that is still facing the need to work through its 20th century past. Within this process, in the discourse of which such notions as truth and justice keep resurfacing, archives and their uses have come to play a considerable role. In this sense, _The Archive as Project_ should be understood as a continuation and expansion of the problematics of the seminar _Archive Fever. The Archives of Contemporary History and Art in Poland After 1989_ (Warsaw, 2009), a forum for (art) historians, curators and artists to discuss the topic and problem of the “archive” in the context of the post-socialist transformations of this part of the world.

<br />

However, it is above all photographic archives, which seem in recent years to have been going through a phase of great public interest and increasing significance, that are at the center of this book. The question of the role of the photographic archive – not only for the humanities, but also for artistic practice and politics – the perspectives it opens and eventual risks it engenders, is one that seems crucial in the wake of the “archival turn” that we saw taking place since mid 90s.

<br />

Considering the causes for this state of things, there are a few worth emphasising as providing a framework for this project: firstly, the reopening of the question of the archive and its “objectivity” in the aftermath of the Cold War (and not only that – in this context the fall of apartheid seems equally pertinent); secondly, the development of new, exceedingly fast technologies of archiving, and the progressive digitalization of information storage and exchange, resulting in the increasingly visible presence and importance of various “archives” in everyday life and in the explosive growth of visual, especially photographic, archives. It is worth mentioning that the “archive,” taken up in the field of art as a crucial problem of (late) modernity already in the 1960s and 70s, returned with a vengeance in the late 90s. There is also the growing interest, in contemporary scholarship, in the visual sphere – visual anthropology and sociology are a case in point, together with visual culture – which has had its share in the thorough re-evaluation of the archive; the site of secrets has become the site of desire.

<br />

The emergence of the “archive” as an object of reflection has been followed by an intensive production of discourse, within which a characteristic split can be observed. A few exceptions notwithstanding, there doesn’t seem to have been a lot of dialogue between authors from the field of the humanities in general, whose interests lay beyond the “literal” understanding of the archive as a site or institution (or who embarked on a critique of its “neutrality”), and professionals working in and on archives themselves, who focused more on the “material” aspects of institution and practice (this, of course, should only be understood as a working distinction). However, the archival turn has also affected the field of archival science and, as it turns out, engendered many changes within it: archivists have realized their own investment in the construction and understanding of history and memory, including identity politics (the “national” archive, etc.) and the fact that theory and practice are not contradictory terms, but “integrated aspects of the archivist’s professional role and <Annotation target="responsibility.”" id="1">Terry Cook, Joan M. Schwartz, “Archives, Records, and Power: From (Postmodern) Theory to (Archival) Performance,” _Archival Science_ 2, no 3–4 (September 2002), p. 171.</Annotation> Yet it does not follow that this reflection has engendered a shared belief in current archival practice. Hence the specific structure of this book. Although divided into six chapters, it is actually composed of three parts or rather – perspectives.

<br />

The first is a theoretical one, as the title “The Archive in Theory” suggests. Here the reader will find texts by acclaimed scholars – and one curator – from the (former) East and West, trying to rethink or actualise various problematic aspects of the archive. John Tagg decided to go back to the critical debates of the 1970s about the “archive” and try to save some of their original gist, which seems to have gone astray in the current, increasingly metaphorical, uses and appropriations of the term. Wolfgang Ernst devoted his article to the archive’s tempor(e)alities; the various temporal and structural characteristics of traditional and digital archives, their relations to memory, and the question of whether the latter can still be called archives proper. In his contribution, Sven Spieker takes up more broadly the issue of entropy as an immanent aspect of the archive, also touched upon by Ernst, through the work of visual artists George Legrady and Antoní Muntadas. Helen Petrovsky reflects on memory, specifically on the possibility of inscribing a shared memory or experience in photographic images (in this case those of Boris Mikhailov), giving them, as images from without and yet perfectly recognisable, a power to interact with our bodies. The relationship between archives and bodies is a key question of Nina Lager Vestberg’s contribution. She tries to address this issue via the concepts of medium and materiality, using A.S. Byatt's 1990 novel _Possession: A Romance_ and Stephen Poliakoff's 1999 BBC television drama, _Shooting the Past_, as case-studies. For André Gunthert, the key issue lies in the myth of all-inclusive archiving, supposedly enabled by digital technologies. He claims that today more than ever one needs to remind oneself that an archive is much more than just a pile of archival material, emphasising the need for a critical methodology of photographic archiving. Nataša Petrešin-Bachelez focuses on the contextual part of _Promises of the Past_, an exhibition of post-war East European art that she co-curated, a living archive of sorts that explores the performative potential of photographic documents.

<br />

Next up is the institutional perspective, where actual practitioners of the art of archiving present initiatives and viewpoints relevant to this place and moment. Thus Miklós Tamási writes about Fortepan, a quite revolutionary website of his, where he makes his entire collection of photographs freely accessible, in high resolution, for everybody. The implications of taking this approach as a model are worth reflecting on. Zuzana Meisnerová-Wismerová also presents a private archive, this time as part of a larger enterprise, the Langhans Foundation, one of the very first private initiatives of this kind in the region, through the Langhans Gallery also actively participating in contemporary photographic culture in the Czech Republic. Grayson Dantzic, who is in charge of the archives of Jerry Dantzic, his father and co-founder of the American Photographers Archives Group, decided to present this grassroots self-help organization through a very personal/biographical contribution. Karolina Lewandowska reflects on private-public partnership as a viable strategy to secure the existence of non-governmental archival institutions whose mode of operation requires steady, secure funding. Tone Rasch from the Norsk Teknisk Museum actually presents a working partnership of this kind in the form of DEXTRA Photo, one that might be taken as model for similar undertakings. Finally, Nikodem Bończa-Tomaszewki, director of the National Digital Archives of Poland, devoted his paper to the larger issues connected to digital archives and archiving, trying to stake out future challenges in this relatively new field.

<br />

The aim of the third, crucial part of this project was to negotiate between the varying perspectives of theory and practice in the previous sections, and to propose a reflective, (self)critical approach in the form of “archival” artistic practice. It is this part of the book that has been split into four separate chapters, mainly because each of them is an autonomous entity of sorts. For “The Archive Looking Awry” four artists working with archives in their work – two from Poland (Wojciech Wilczyk and Karol Radziszewski), one from Slovakia (Lucia Nimcova), and one from Lebanon (Akram Zaatari) – have been invited to discuss its various aspects and broader implications with four “theorists”: a cultural critic (Iwona Kurz), a queer theorist (Tomasz Basiuk), an anthropologist (Ewa Klekot), and a political philosopher (Ariella Azoulay). Each pair was free to choose the exact form of their contribution, and the results are a dialogue, a critical essay followed by a montaged exchange between the participants, a short introduction with critical elaboration, and two separate presentations working in the same direction of transgressing political borders and projecting the possibility of new beginnings from two sides of a deep divide. The latter is in fact the description of the chapter composed by Ariella Azoulay and Akram Zaatari, who each deal with civil disaster in their own way, trying to open imaginary alternatives, imaginary in the fullest political sense. Iwona Kurz and Wojciech Wilczyk discuss the archival aspects of documentary photography through the artist’s own documentary projects, especially the inventory-like _There is no such Thing as an Innocent Eye_ that speaks in a pertinent way about Polish-Jewish memory and the traces of this culture in the landscape. Karol Radziszewski and Tomasz Basiuk’s contribution takes up another important topic, that of a possible alternative history of gay culture in (post-)socialist Poland on the basis of an archival find of Karol Radziszewski’s that makes such an alternative imaginable, even graspable. Finally, the exchange between Lucia Nimcová and Eva Klekot is a fascinating opening into a reflection on the practice of everyday life and the memory of the body during and after socialism in this part of the world.

<br />

Those chapters and perspectives came into being as a result of staking out a number of starting points for this endeavor, thematic threads the reader will find resurfacing in various constellations throughout the specific contributions. Crystallising in different forms, they will hopefully permit the reader to recognise the archive as a phenomenon that is caught up in relations of power, and see its potential to be both a site of dissent and of a repartition of the sensible (in Rancière’s terms). Those threads were as follows:

<br />

**The poetics/politics of the archive**. Within the larger “archival turn” itself, two supplementary tendencies can be observed: on the one hand, the blurring of boundaries between institutions such as the library, the museum (including the museum of art) and the archive, and a certain semantic inflation of the term “archive” itself, so that it encompasses ever more distant phenomena. The resulting “metaphorical” or “aesthetic” use of the term, which is becoming increasingly common, could lead to a neutralization of its political dimension. Therefore a certain reassessment of its specific poetics (the principle of construction) and politics (the aims of that construction) seems indispensable today. Of particular interest in this context are the uses of the archive as institution and metaphor in current scholarly and artistic practice.

<br />

**The totality/fragmentariness of the archive**. Considering the fact that the universalist ambitions of the archive have already been subject to repeated criticism – in the guise of collecting a totality of knowledge and constructing an all-encompassing narrative, both intimately tied to issues of power and empire – this problem seems to belong to the past. At the same time, however, in spite of the ever-growing potential to store digital data and consolidate archives (i.e. Corbis, The Library of Congress), with the arduousness of proper digitalization straining the promise and ease of universal access, and the costs of storing the abounding numbers of “originals,” the problem of selection recurs. The questions pertaining to that problematic are the following: What should archives archive, and what part of their collection should be made accessible, on what terms? What should the criteria of selection be, and who should enforce them? Should we be concerned about private archives that do not disclose their politics of acquisition and publication? If so, in what ways and to what extent? How do we understand the construction of an archive?

<br />

**Memory, history and the question of technology**. Many things have also been said about the memory structure of the archive, the archive as a supplement of memory and its status as source for history. The acknowledgement that the event is being produced in the process of archiving to the same extent as it is preserved also compels us to recognize that changes in the technologies and strategies of archiving may fundamentally redefine our understanding of the possibilities of evoking and narrating what is past. Thus the question of if and in what way our understanding of event, document and documentation has changed since the “archival turn” is doubtlessly one worth posing. Is it not time to reconsider our view of the archive as a site and its function as a repository? Or, to phrase it differently, will or can digitalization fulfill the promise of universal access? What conclusions can be drawn from these questions for new institutions with archival ambitions?

<br />

**Photography in the archive – questions of acquisition, research, and publicity**. This set of what would appear to be purely practical questions should be tackled in the context of the above theoretical issues, trying to establish as close a relation as possible between the theory and the practice of the archive. At the same time, the archive’s double status as mnemonic device should be stressed, that is, on the one hand, as a certain technology of representation (and so construction, fiction, death), on the other hand, revealing its relationship with a certain modality of the past that constitutes its material basis. This double status seems to require further reflection, the more so because, interestingly, the archive seems to share this indexical-representational character with the photograph – which could turn out to be a productive analogy.

<br />

**The archive holy/unholy – the archive secret/public**. One of the essential features of archives used to be their inaccessibility. With the feasibility of digital representation, however, new modes of public existence were conceived for archival collections, simultaneously rendering rare originals all the more inaccessible. What seems most interesting in this context is the process whereby private collections, very often stored in unfavourable conditions or still being actively used, are withdrawn from the sphere of use and sacralized in such a way that their preservation for posterity seems to sever them from this posterity in the same gesture. Thus the question needs to be posed, to what extent can the contemporary archive be exposed to profanation (understood as a returning to free use)? This question is directed especially towards the artists invited to participate in this project, for whom the archive as a notion, institution and site is part of their artistic practice.

<br />

Hopefully all of these thematics and their different interrelations will be clearly legible in this book, permitting us to seriously consider the question, is it possible to identify and neutralize the automatisms (and bad faith) at work in archival practice? The aim of such a critical gesture is to strive, not for the archive’s even more perfect transparency, but towards a conscious, explicit conception of its construction and politics, towards an understanding the archive as a **project**, a certain potentiality, a challenge for the future.
