# History as Guerrilla. The Discourse and Pragmatics of the Photographic Archive

<Author link="/chapter_22">André Gunthert</Author>

Upon the invention of the daguerreotype, the astronomer François Arago enthusiastically announced that the new invention’s inherent capability to archive all that is visual would enable one “to copy the millions of hieroglyphics which cover even the exterior of the great monuments of Thebes, Memphis, <Annotation target="Karnak.”" id="1">François Arago, “Report,” in Josef Maria Eder, _History of Photography_, trans. Edward Epstean (New York, 1945), 234-235.</Annotation> Fortunately, photography and cinema did preserve many traces of the past. However, contrary to the great documentary project that has haunted the history of images, this universal archive as imagined by Arago turned out to be incredibly fragile, fragmentary and precarious. Only today, when the legacy of the great photo agencies, such as Gamma, Sygma or Sipa, are condemned to dispersal, do we begin to fathom that photography, capable of faithfully recording everything, counts among the worst archival objects: too complex to restore and to interpret, too expensive to maintain, it becomes a heritage in ruins, a nightmare for history.

<br />

The thinking on photographic heritage is structured by two myths. The first, aimed at the future and describing an easily manufactured, reliable and cheap automatic memory, starts to wane in the 1930s, only to reappear with the rise of the digital form. The second, directed towards the past and more successful in withstanding the workings of time, considers the traces of photographic practice as an equivalent of paper archives.

<br />

In March 2010 _Le_ _Monde_ sounded the alarm: “A lack of funds is threatening the photographic archives of _France-Soir_” at the Bibliothèque historique de la Ville de Paris. “About two weeks ago close to 200 large boxes and 400 black albums containing photographs were removed from their shelves and thrown, one on the other and held together by adhesive tape, in a corner of the library. The vision is sinister and the future of the collection <Annotation target="uncertain.”" id="2">Michel Guerrin, “Le manque de moyens met en péril les archives photos de _France-Soir_”, _Le Monde_, 16 March 2010.</Annotation>

<br />

Yet this “sinister vision” seems to be ungrounded, as it merely corresponds to the need to transfer the prints in order to secure their archiving. Since the moment of its deposit in 1986, the archive was subject to only one partial, thematic inventory, centered on the topic “Paris and its surroundings”. 45 000 photographs were restored, less than 10% of its estimated half a million documents. But the _Le_ _Monde_ article constructs a romantic vision of the collection as cultural heritage _in_ _itself,_ requiring conservation without any need for valorisation, thereby making the perspective of its dislocation seem like a threat rather than the chance it is.

It would be a fallacy to accept the idea that our cultural memory is protected by a few specialised institutions, and that the gaps in this heritage are scandalous exceptions. The general public is eager to hear narratives of endangered archives, but they introduce a false perspective. Unfortunately, quite the opposite is true: in the case of the remains of past popular culture or culture industries, conservation is an exception and loss the banal rule.

<br />

The case of the _France-Soir_ archive reflects the challenges of a modification in scale. In comparison with the few thousands of historical photographs in the collection of the Musée d'Orsay, carefully selected by curators who appreciated their aesthetic value, the heterogeneous sets of millions of documents left over from history pose new questions, require other methods.

<br />

In the context of the debates around the archive, no idea is more pervasive than the one that photographic collections are cultural heritage in and of themselves, whose value alone legitimates their conservation. “In their offer for the takeover, Sud Communication did not even mention Sipa’s extraordinary heritage. I bought the Delmas agency with Raymond Depardon’s photographs. We bought many photographic collections. Their value is substantial!” explained Göksin Sipahioglu, founder of the Sipa agency, announcing its takeover by DAPD.

<br />

It is the assumption that photographic collections should be treated as archives that legitimates this approach. This in turn entails forgetting about the fact that the establishment of the system of norms governing paper archives that lends contemporary institutional archives their value, permitting historians to structure their research in an efficient manner, is the fruit of extended theoretical and practical work on the nature of documents and the organisation of classifications. An archive is not simply a stock of documents, but the effect of a process of organisation allowing for an easy retrieval of information later on. The precondition of such work on structure is knowledge about what is to be retrieved.

<br />

The reason that contemporary photographic collections cannot be compared to historical archives is that we simply don’t know what the questions are that they should be answering.

<br />

Many curators will describe better than I the extreme complexity of the structure of photographic collections. Let us keep in mind this simple idea: conservation, adequate storage and organisation of photographic archives is much more costly than that of paper documents. This is why the creation and conservation of most photographic collections to date was embedded in the logic of the market and not that of cultural heritage.

<br />

Even Paul Frosh, in his important study _The_ _Image_ _Factory,_ claims that photo agencies cease to treat their pictures as valuable the moment they pass the threshold of <Annotation target="actuality." id="3">Paul Frosh, _The Image factory. Consumer Culture, Photography and the Visual Content Industry_ (Oxford: Berg, 2003).</Annotation> But the reason for the conservation of agency archives is exactly that press images continue to be valuable after their initial publication. The archives of photo agencies or newspapers are thus organised according to criteria that facilitate their subsequent use. We still haven’t gotten past a very general understanding of the logic of visual journalism. What is striking, though, is the disparity between the heroic and romantic vision of a photojournalist who, risking his life, brings back images of distant tragedies from the end of the world, and the reality of photographic collections, in a substantial part dedicated to actors, actresses and other celebrities, where we are quick to recognise that the images have value more as commodities than as cultural heritage.

<br />

Photo-journalistic archives tell us primarily not about events, but about the very nature of photojournalism. Their strategy of the conservation of photographs, based on multiplying duplicates to guarantee their availability (which in turn means entering into conflict with the photographers as copyright holders), is quite telling as concerns the specific uses of those photographs.

Those very uses, little known outside of the profession, are at the heart of the process that led Dominique Aubert to oppose Sygma-Corbis. He decided to prosecute the agency over the loss of 753 of his pictures, selected by its editors for publication (so-called “red dots”), while others among them were still in circulation without the author’s consent. Those two cases, that ultimately led to the liquidation of Sygma-Corbis and the agency’s collection, are directly linked to the problem of the classification of archives that privileges not the author but the represented event, and also to the practices of disseminating multiple copies, allowing for parallel publication.

<br />

The question of archiving, which turns out to be a basic aspect of photojournalistic practice, deconstructs the romantic myth of the journalist-photographer still very much present in photographic culture, laying bare the economic logic of a much less heroic, industrial reality.

<br />

Attempts at tackling this industrial phenomenon, undertaken in the recent work of scholars such as Paul Frosh or Matthias Bruhn, are still sparse. Indeed, one must admit that it is very difficult to preserve the memory of industrial processes, as they tend to be secret by nature and surely assume the creation of documentary ensembles whose existence is dependent solely on their profitability for the enterprise. The recent news about the closure of the Sygma archives at Garnay and the impossibility of funding similar collections through public institutions should be a serious warning for scholars.

<br />

Such industrial uses, inscribed in the archive in latent form, can be made visible only by very attentive studies. At the same time a certain cult of the material archive, apparent in the calls for saving this or that collection, obscures the enormous amount of information necessary to understand the ways in which archives are used and to grasp their specific traits, a task attainable exclusively through interviews with their users. I do believe that this live history is not perceived as equally important as the history of objects. However, if it is ignored, an archive becomes but a fossil, closed to historical interpretation.

<br />

One of the most important factors determining the use of 20th century collections of documents today is the issue of copyright. As the Corbis case shows, it can block or complicate the commercial use, that is the condition of the preservation of such collections, be they public or private.

<br />

The introduction of digital technologies in the 1990s resurrected the myth of the automatic, simple and cheap archiving machine. The practical and economic problems connected to the digitalisation of documents have quickly made it apparent that digital archiving was as deceptive a promise as photographic archiving turned out to be. But there is one more lesson to be learned from this, one that seems to have gone unnoticed. Its symptoms could be observed on the example of the _Les Parisiens sous l'occupation_, an exhibition of digital prints of color slides by André Zucca, organised in 2008 by the Bibliothèque historique de la Ville de Paris.

An analysis of the scans from 2006, carried out by a specialized firm, showed that in the case of many pictures color corrections were applied in addition to a more systematic retouching process, as a consequence of which all spots, scratches, pricks and other deficiencies disappeared from the photographs selected for the show. Such corrections, understandable in the case of an exhibition, have other, less felicitous effects: from the moment of the inception of digital reproductions, their availability encouraged their users not to consult the originals, henceforth depending exclusively on digital collections. Yet those collections do not offer transparent and faithful copies of the originals (as the doctrine of digital photography makes us believe), but images doubly transformed through digital tools _and_ their visualisation on the screen. Indeed, were we to compare the digital originals with the color slides, we couldn’t but notice that our perception of those images had been altered by certain supplemental devices. Looking at the original films, we would take into account the reference culture connected to them, allowing us to correct the interpretation and refer the changes in hue and other visual effects to the characteristics of the medium. Whereas on the screen, apart from the changes in size, brightness and hue it induces, the rarefied character of the historical document in the contemporary visual environment also produces a certain discrepancy, stressing its singularity.

<br />

Looking at those pictures, the beholder experienced them as unreal or paradoxically contemporary: those contradictory reactions of the audience to the pictures presented at the exhibition were well grounded, given that what they saw was not historical testimony, but a digital chimera, deprived of all markers of time, a photographic Disneyland, cleansed of its history with the help of Photoshop. The lesson to be learned from this example is clear. Taking into account the fact that the process of digitalisation results in the loss of the reference to the original, henceforth replaced by a more practical object, such a process should be entrusted to the competence of conservationists and carried through under the supervision of specialists. As with photography, which ultimately did not turn out to be the transparent and neutral medium the 19th-century critics dreamed of, the visual characteristics of digital copies stem from a series of choices connected to issues of conservation rather than reproduction.

<br />

Finally, I would like to stress that an archive without scholars researching it is as useless as a pile of dry leaves. We have to be conscious of the fact that tendencies predominant in the landscape of European education pose a serious threat to the very possibility of researching our own culture. In this less and less stable context we should be delighted to see that the practices of the photographic archive have become an object of scholarship.

<br />

As we have seen, the questions raised by the research and conservation of contemporary archives of visual documents are numerous and complicated. It will be the task of the researchers to map the most interesting points of departure for ambitious scholarship, appropriate to the challenges posed by these new objects of history. Taking into account the economical, legal and practical difficulties I have referred to, it is possible that the conditions we all would hope for might not arise quickly enough. This is why it is so important to continue our work meanwhile. Facing the risk of the irretrievable disappearance of important collections, it is our responsibility to continue by all means our observation, even in substandard conditions that might seriously narrow our perspective. In fact, we do not have a choice: we have to prepare the ground for future research and from here on to fight the battle of history as guerrillas.
