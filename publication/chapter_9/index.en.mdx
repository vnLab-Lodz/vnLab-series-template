# Unmaking National Borders: Photographic Records as Tools

<Author link="/chapter_22">Akram Zaatari</Author>

Like that moment when you find yourself in prison and you can’t stop yourself from thinking of freedom; when you live in a war, it’s impossible not to think of peace. I would have loved to be able to address peaceful moments in my work and give wars less space than I have given them. But, given where I live, and what I have lived, I cannot allow myself this privilege. Very often, my generation of Lebanese artists has been criticized for having capitalized on the war too much as a subject for art works, as if we worked on it too much.

<br />

I wish it were different.

<br />

And I would be curious to know if you shared this feeling Ariela, as a scholar who primarily worked on photography in relationship to regimes of power and to photographs of war, as a researcher interested in looking for photographic documents, and questioning them in relation to “a history” of occupation. In other terms, I wonder if there was room for any other focus in your work, outside occupation and the military translation of power? But I ask myself the same question. One of the questions that we share.

<br />

Anyway, putting this aside, I’m known to many of you for being a key player in an organization that was created in Beirut, the Arab Image Foundation. I was one of a few players, who, very innocently, in 1997, thought of starting to collect photographs, building a collection for the future. With that thought, there has always been this concern to archive, to secure a proper home for photographs, and at the same time the project was for many of us a project of studying, learning about photographic practices. For us back then, it seemed clear that this could not happen without displacing photographs from their domestic context into a cultural one, where images become objects of study, accessible to a general unrestricted public.

<br />

From the beginning, the project carried that duality, the idea of “preservation” and the notion of “study”. The foundation has developed further with artists’ reflection and work, becoming a platform to generate a collection that is made by artistic and scholarly practice, each bringing selections that resulted from their research, their interests, in other terms, to generate archives through fieldwork.

<br />

That was 14 years ago. Today I see a lot of limits in that project and in the way it was conceived, although I’d never regret being at its starting point. I believe it’s great that the Arab Image Foundation still exists and is still able to act as such a platform besides serving a larger community of researchers, promoting the practice of collecting and issues related to preservation.

I’m starting with this image, which is in reality a short video of a still scene inside the conservation room at the AIF’s office in Beirut. It doesn’t show any pictures, just the archival boxes they are stored in (il. 1). With time, what concerns me is something that is not directly represented in an image, but something that is evoked either by the act of its making, or with time. With time, a photograph drifts, encountering different people with different interests, and maybe gets overturned completely as reality it depicted changes.

<br />

With time, I realized that what draws me is not only individual images, but photographic bodies. For long, I worked at trying to read images as texts, as cultural texts, trying to analyze them while looking particularly at the modern period, how photographs served to diffuse notions related to modern times, not necessarily modernity as a whole. Photography was a vehicle to promote some kind of lifestyle that people wanted to belong to. In my early research I focused on this period because it was a moment when photography was becoming accessible to a wide range of people, which was not the case in the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries. Photography in the fifties was being widely used by the middle and working classes, and mostly domesticated.

<br />

Having been exposed to photography’s history, I was struck by how some of those images resembled other existing photographic forms, particularly documentary. Except that the photographs that I was studying were not documentary, but were an extension of studio practices. They came to exist for particular economic reasons and played a specific function in the lives of those who requested them to be made. This is how I started to look at the details of the daily practices of commercial photographers, and this is how I started interviewing many of them, and later focusing on Hashem el Madani, trying to understand how photographers of that period made decisions regarding framing, lighting, etc. I was trying to expand the definition of studio practice to include outdoor practices of portraiture that were related to commercial studios and that were made by itinerant and photo-surprise photographers (a practice that was based on taking pedestrians in urban centers by surprise and giving them their pictures later.).

<br />

With time, I was less and less interested in the pictures themselves, less inclined to look at pictures as texts, and more intrigued by the practices that created those pictures. From there on I turned to the study of photographic practices, and after looking at a picture, I would seek another set of information that the picture alone could not communicate. I would get it from the sequence of images on a negative, or from the box that the picture or negative was in. By doing this, I was silencing my inclination to subscribe those pictures to practices they did not belong to.

<br />

All of a sudden, what were considered unsuccessful pictures started to intrigue me, because they informed me about the practice of photography more than perfectly exposed ones. I was becoming interested in how photographers produced their pictures, and was wondering about the details of their practice. For me, the practice of a studio couldn’t be represented only as a photographic archive, but as an unbreakable tissue that includes the place and all the material in it, including its latent links and hidden orders.

I was developing interest in looking at, contemplating, what might seem opaque: in other terms an encounter with shelves, boxes and metallic cans is an encounter with an opaque image that doesn’t tell you much. Only when I present it as my work, only when I bring to light what has been latent, only then will the viewer be able to make sense of what it really was about. To repeat, an image of a cardboard box doesn’t tell you much until you start looking at the pictures in it; when you go one step back, you get a whole new meaning. At first, an image seems to tell you nothing, but later it turns out to be full of stories, narratives. It’s exactly this that interests me in this image. These are the metallic boxes in which photographer Hashem el Madani stored his 35mm negatives (il. 2). When you dive into an archive, as an archaeologist looking for images in a particular place, your first encounter would be something like this scene, before you can process them and be able to enjoy a specific random picture from the archive. It is this journey between an opaque “dull” image/encounter and a shining one replete with stories that constitutes my work.

<br />

I have been collecting many stories connected to the production of photographs of the Arab context of the Middle East, particularly my immediate social context. This is a quite well known image because it has been shown a lot as part of the exhibition *Hashem el Madani: Studio Practices*. It is an image of a very particular instance, when el Madani, the photographer, had to scratch the negative of the portrait of Mrs Baqari after her husband came to him one day claiming that this picture was taken without his permission (Il. 3). It’s that kind of moments that I was interested in, after having worked extensively on reading images either thematically or visually, as texts. In this picture, what attracts me is not something that is in the picture. It is not something that the photographer intended to do, but something that escaped him completely and made his photograph relate better – in the eyes of an archaeologist/ethnographer – to the social context of the image. So this image led me to focus my attention on the practice of photography in a particular social context, and in this case a context where photography is not easily accepted. That moment led me to look further into how a photographer worked, which tools he worked with, and really, it helped me consider this place, this studio as a site for ongoing excavation, where not only images are important, but also whatever exists outside them, the tools, the cameras, and the photographer himself. From there on, I think the issue of preservation is not about preserving emulsion or paper anymore. It is not only about preserving pictures and negatives, it’s about preserving the set of objects that existed around them, including the photographer, furniture, machines, and cardboard boxes. I started working on different ways of displaying the outcome of this excavation, including working with machines that were available to me, like trying to display all the machines that the photographer possessed and displayed in every vitrine in his studio; recorders, later super 8 cameras, projectors, flashes, tools and everything. I could no longer isolate pictures from whatever situations came to exist around them, and what has inevitably changed them. I’m going to cut this short, because I want to reach where I could extend this further and make use of Ariela’s presence on the same podium. And let’s then talk about the historie(s) of Israel and Palestine. Let’s talk about what could be done across sealed borders.

I would like to bring the following images into our discussion. These are images I collected in 1998 from Palestinian families who lived in Jordan. This is a picture taken by Hisham Abdel-Hadi in Jericho sometime in the early sixties, and it portrays members of his family: his future wife and two of her relatives (Il. 4). This is another picture from Jaffa, from Samia Salfiti, whose grandmother was French-Alsace, from the Roch family. It’s a family that settled in Palestine for a long time, who was later displaced to Jordan, and the photograph here shows a masquerade party that they held at home to commemorate Easter in 1933. They used to do theme parties, and the theme that year was *Commedia* *dell’Arte* (Il. 5). And this third picture is a very specific one, because it seems to be a very ordinary picture of a mansion house. I collected it from an old woman named Samiyeh Khairi, who comes from the Taji family in Wadi Hnein near Ramleh in <Annotation target="Palestine" id="1">*Palestine Remembered*, accessed April 20, 2011, http://www.palestineremembered.com/al-Ramla/Wadi-Hunayn/index.html</Annotation>. She had very few pictures left of that time, so she could only give me this one of her family house, where she grew up. Her father, the renowned notable Abdel-Rahman al Taji, had built it sometime in the twenties, and the family lived in it until their displacement in 1948 (Il. 6). Today, the house functions as a sanatorium known as the Weitzman Institute in Nes Ziona (Nes Ziona Psychiatric Hospital<Annotation target=")" id="2">*Weitzman Institute In Nes Ziona*, accessed April 20, 2011, http://www.beer-ness.co.il/.</Annotation>. The tragic loss of Palestine in 1948 and the consequent loss of properties suffered by most Palestinian families, who were forced to leave home, made this picture acquire a significance that goes far beyond that which was initially represented in it. My work is often a re-activation of existing documents, often transformed by realities around them. In other terms, my work sits on research findings that very often take a lot of time until I find their way into a work, or until I find my way to re-activate them into a work.

<br />

Last year I made a video work entitled: *On* *Photography,* *People* *and* *Modern* *Times*. I used the research that I did in 1998–1999 with the objective of constituting the nucleus-collection of the Arab Image Foundation. In this work, I wanted to portray the dual home of those photographs. On one hand it is the conservation room of the Arab Image Foundation today. On the other hand it is the former context in which photographs existed when in the hands of families that owned them. I think that much of this comes from the fact that once in the hands of an institution, photographs go through procedures following preservation standards, which makes them a bit less physically accessible than they might have been when they lived with “their” families. In 1998–1999 I always documented the families from whom I took photographs on video, because I wanted to keep track of that initial context. So the work entitled *On* *Photography,* *People* *and* *Modern* *Times* juxtaposes those two contexts. In forty minutes, you see many characters talking about their pictures, in Cairo, in Amman, Alexandria and Lebanon. Here you will see the four characters talking about their pictures, which I showed you earlier.

The first, Aida Krikorian, is the granddaughter of Garabed Krikorian and the daughter of Johannes Krikorian, who are both well-known photographers from Jerusalem, where she was born, before being displaced to Amman. This is an interview that I made with her in Amman in 1998. My initial interest behind the making of the interview was to capture people’s relationship to their pictures before that moment of departure, before they departed from their pictures and never saw them again. Their pictures became a part of the collection of the Arab Image Foundation, and they received same-size modern reproductions of them. I am starting with her to give you a hint of photographic practice in Palestine before 1948.

<br />

The second is Hisham Abdel Hadi, who today lives in Amman as well. He talks about his pictures. You see him inserting the reproductions that he got back from the AIF into the album that contained them with other pictures. You see him inserting the reproductions in the exact places that the original images were, where he had left numbered paper marks. Most of the photographs that I collected in this period were family pictures that did not actually show war, and rarely reflected it. They reflected the life people lived mostly in Palestine, before their displacement. Unlike the pictures that form Ariela’s archives, these pictures were not taken to cover war stories. Besides, they were taken neither by journalists nor by the state.

<br />

The essence of my practice lies in displacing documents into another territory different from their original one. So when I did _On_ _Photography…_ I was constantly thinking of the strategy that always governed my practice with pictures, displacement. It’s very important for me to take pictures outside their context in order to be able to build upon them, make them function differently, in another context.

<br />

The third character that you will hear is Samia Salfiti, and the fourth is Samiyeh Khairi. You will see her talking about that house, which today has been transformed into a psychiatric hospital after it was in the hands of the Israeli authorities under what is known in Israel as the “Absentees Property Law.” The house has a mythical presence in the life of the entire family. In the nineties after the Oslo Accords, members of her family were able to visit their home. They were allowed to enter to have a look, and they took the picture that you see here at the end of the film.

## _On Photography, People and Modern Times_ (excerpts)

**Aida** **Krikorian:**

<br />

– Do you remember your father Garabed?

– I did not know my grandfather, because he died before I was born.

Mom got married young but she stayed nine years without children. During those years my grandfather died. He never knew that my father begot a daughter. And my mother used to say: “I appreciated it. He never, in any gesture or word, expressed his disappointment in not having grandchildren. Never.”

Then I was born. Of course he was dead by then. But mom used to speak very highly of him.

<br />

– Did you use to go to your father’s studio?

– I went often. I used to play with a basket full of little things, villagers’ outfits that they used to wear and be photographed with. Mom used to go almost daily to the studio. She did some retouching. In the beginning he had a retoucher. I don’t know why he left later. She also helped dress some of the ladies in villagers’ clothes.

<br />

– What other accessories did they offer?

– There were many. It’s a pity that much of it is gone. Other than the Bedouin clothes that my mother was photographed with, there were the Bethlehem clothes, the Ramallah dresses like the one I am photographed with, and gowns, head outfits, swords for men.

<br />

**Hisham** **Abdelhadi:**

<br />

– That MG! In 1956, when I was still young, I was fond of the MG racecar, the TC model. In this picture, I am driving through Jerusalem and in the background is the well-known Gethsemane church.

<br />

– Did you buy the car?

– Yes. I bought 3 MG cars one after another, and that was the third one. I was a fan. I used to drive to Lebanon and race up the mountain in Dahr el Baidar.

<br />

– This picture on the left, where was it taken?

– That was taken on the road to the Dead Sea.

<br />

– Do you remember this occasion?

– I remember it. I was very young. This is Palestine. I don’t recall when. I think I was six or seven years old and we were watching the German Graf Zeppelin in the sky when he flew over Jerusalem. I heard later that it burnt. I think it was called Hindenburg.

<br />

– Did you know in advance that it was coming?

– Yes we were waiting for it, and suddenly something huge appeared in the sky.

<br />

– Did it land?

– No it flew over us.

I took this picture when I bought my first BMW. It was 1.5L. I drove it to Jericho. In the picture are my family members, including my fiancée, with the daughter of Dr. Khalil Budeiry, my niece, and the daughter of Said Basha Al Mufti. These are very old memories. Now time flies.

<br />

– Did you ask them to sit on the car’s front?

– I was fond of taking pictures and thought this made a nice composition. Those were fun days.

<br />

**Samia** **Salfiti:**

<br />

She heard her from the second floor. She came down asking about the story of this woman.

– Who?

– The wife of the French consul. When she heard us, she came down. I told her that I was born in this house (in Yaffa) and I would like to have a look at it. It seems she knows the history of this region. When I told her that my mother is from the Roch family, she recognized me because the family’s name was on most of what was at home, the books, etc...

She was sympathetic and immediately she said come in what can I do for you? And she was so nice that she wanted to give me the things.

The masquerade party!

The family of my mother was a bit avant-garde compared to their peers because they studied in France, and because my grandmother was French. So they used to do these parties for fun.

They used to have this lower salon, as an oriental sitting, and used it for parties. They did yearly masquerade parties to celebrate Easter, so there are two photographs. In one of them, they are all wearing oriental clothes, princes and sultans. And in this one, they are all dressed like Pierrots, i.e. clowns, _Commedia_ _dell’arte._

<br />

**Samiyeh** **Khairy:**

<br />

– This is the house where I grew up and lived until I got married, and you want me to go there and see it in the hands of Jews? I refuse to go.

My son went two years ago, during the summer. I told him you should take your kids to see their country. They went to visit, but people there were about to throw him out. “How dare you come here?” He said: This is the house of my grandfather, my mother’s father. Then, an officer came and apologized and told him that those people didn’t know who he was, and invited him inside to have a look at the house.

He said: Mom, the house is frustrating. He remembers it because he left when he was seven, so he knows his grandfather’s house. He said the house is frustrating. It is full of Jewish writings and photographs although they had kept my father’s photo on the wall, as the portrait of the notable who built it.

They asked him if he was the <Annotation target="Beik’s" id="3">A title.</Annotation> grandson? He told them that it was his mother’s father.

<br />

– The sisters used to accompany you from school back home before the holidays?

– Yes they used to say: We will come and have tea at Abdel Rahman Beik’s for the smell of oranges.

They used to walk two to three km in the middle of the fields, and the smell of oranges filling the place. They used to say that it was like nothing they had seen before.

<br />

So from there on, trying to build upon the last interview, trying to build on that photograph of a property that still belongs to that family although – given the political situation – they is denied access to it. Besides, the house today serves a different community, a different function. So in trying to make a case out of this photograph and this history, I started doing research, first on the Internet, then with friends, and found that a website called Palestine <Annotation target="Remembered" id="4">*Palestine Remembered*, accessed April 20, 2011, http://www.palestineremembered.com/</Annotation> dedicated space to all sorts of documents and stories about Palestinian villages, and particularly to Ramleh, and has included pictures of Abdel-Rahman el Taji’s house, including this picture. What’s interesting about this picture in particular is that it is in color, so it’s been taken recently, I mean after the Israeli authorities officially listed it under the absentee law. Despite that, in it you see Abdel-Rahman el Taji and his visitors standing on the stairs. But browsing through other pictures in this folder, I found this picture, which makes it very clear that the first picture had been subject to collage work. The figures of el Taji and his visitors were copied from this old black and white picture, kept in black and white, and pasted into this recent color picture. It makes the result a bit odd, yet very meaningful as it combines two times, two moments, two functions like a fantasy; one before and another one after occupation. In this website you find many pictures taken when the family still lived at home. And while looking for the Ness Ziona hospital’s website, I was surprised to see this recent image of the same house right on the introductory page.

<br />

I showed the interview with Samiyeh Khairi to my friend Avi Mograbi, the Israeli filmmaker, and asked him if he was interested in going to visit that place. This question/mission came naturally after our collaboration last year at the _Laboratoires_ _d’Aubervilliers_. It was a performance called _A_ _Conversation_ _with_ _an_ _Imagined_ _Israeli_ _Filmmaker_ _named_ _Avi_ _Mograbi_, in which each one of us brought his pictures, and we tried to talk about our encounters with the idea of enemy. We talked about Arabs, Israelis, trying to unmake definitions of nationalities, nations, trying to unmake borders – hypothetically – between nations, and asked questions like who is the Israeli and who is the Arab, very innocently, even naively.

<br />

Showing this interview to Avi Mograbi, seeking help, came from my belief (which I am sure is shared by Avi) that one cannot look at these documents and continue to obey or respect current national, ideological contracts. I really think that some kind of disobedience, a betrayal of the national, has to happen, where maybe transgression is inevitable. As part of our collaboration I gave Avi many assignments to do in Israel. And going to visit Ness Ziona was an additional mission for him. To cut things short, a few weeks later, Avi sent me this video.

<br />

In our collaboration, this is his fifth mission. You will see him talking to a guard, who is obviously of African descent, asking for permission to film and bringing up the fact that this the house belonged to a Palestinian family. He will later explain absentee law to the guard.

<br />

I would like to finish with two paragraphs by Irit Rogoff, where she writes about transcending current conditions and locations around us. She writes:

> Perhaps one of the ways of doing so [of transcending our conditions and location] is by an understanding that Geography is not location but a situated knowledge – who we are, where we are, what we know – what our heritages and allegiances are – has always been linked to geography not as a set of locating vectors but rather to yoke places to traditions and trajectories of knowledge. Each place “knows” differently and if they are not to be related to one another in dated and irrelevant notions of “knowledge from the center” vs. “knowledge from periphery,” then how might they produce circular movements of knowledge, which defies geographical subjugation? The concept of Exhausted Geographies that I’m trying to discuss here, is a concept that is trying to work against the grain of both the boundaries of the possible and of location as a site of identity and knowledge<Annotation target="." id="5">Irit Rogoff, “Exhausted Geographies,” in: *Stop Making Sense*, ed. Marianne Hultman (Oslo, 2010), 108.</Annotation>

And she later writes:

> And so I’ve been thinking of exhaustion in relation to political conflict, not as a mode of opting out and withdrawing, but as one of recognizing the limits of a logic that has dominated that conflict for most of its duration. I suspect, that this will take a form of an act of treason, in Deleuze's sense of treachery, a refusal to support and sustain that which demands it of you because it claims to support and sustain you – for in the realm of living out long term political conflict, treason and exhaustion are not unrelated to one another<Annotation target="." id="6">Ibid.</Annotation>

At these moments of political exhaustion we might actually exit a mode that seeks resolution to conflict, and enter another temporality which is one of “inhabitation.”
