In 2008, I began work on a special issue of my self-published periodical, _DIK Fagazine_. It was entirely devoted to the life of homosexuals in Central and Eastern Europe before 1989. While I was digging into the subject and searching for resources, I met many different people whom I then interviewed. This is how I came across Ryszard Kisiel, among others. At first I only knew that in the 1980s he had been publishing _Filo_, the first – half-legally distributed among friends – gay zine in this part of Europe. During subsequent meetings that took place at Kisiel’s home in Gdańsk, I had a chance to get acquainted with his extensive archive, which allowed me to discover new facts about the gay community of the period and learn about various aspects of his activities.

  One day Ryszard pulled out a plastic bag full of carefully annotated boxes
  containing almost 300 colour slides. As it turned out, these were documented
  photographic sessions arranged by Kisiel and his friends in one of their
  private apartments. The slides were made at the end of 1985 and the beginning
  of 1986 as a direct reaction to the “Hyacinth” action (a large-scale operation
  of Citizens’ Militia whose objective was to collect information about Polish
  gays and their environment, and which resulted in the registering of around
  11000 personal files). As Kisiel admits: “Once they started to uncover us,
  there was no point in staying hidden any more. We had nothing to lose, so we
  decided to do our own thing and not be bothered by anything.”

The slides I discovered do not seem shocking; however, they break with
stereotypical ways of thinking about that time in the People’s Republic of
Poland and are a specific visual testimony of the period. They challenge the
image of the homosexual as a hounded victim, revealing instead a great
potential for positive energy, irony (also towards such taboo subjects as
AIDS) and most of all self-irony, which today’s LGBT activists often miss.

  Within the slide collection it was possible to discern a few distinct groups
  of photos. Perhaps the most spectacular one is a conceptual and word-game
  based sequence resembling “film credits,” which was a long series of
  inscriptions pasted down directly onto the naked body of Waldek (Kisiel’s
  model and lover). Beside the nude and disguise sessions, such as
  *Badziewianka*, *Szamanka* or *Fakir*, there are private images of the lover
  in the woods, a selection of snapshots taken at the nude beach in Bulgaria
  (Kisiel travelled a lot to the neighbouring countries of the Eastern Bloc,
  documenting sites of gay meetings, cruising, saunas) or photographs depicting
  what had been happening behind the scenes of the “proper photo sessions.”

  Clear references to the *Do It Yourself* aesthetic, the expression of
  sexuality deprived of prudishness (a confrontational attitude towards
  still-present Polish sexophobia), the great self-awareness and the distance –
  all of it made me think of Ryszard Kisiel as an authentic and extremely
  important point of reference. Eventually, it also resulted in inviting Kisiel
  to my studio in Warsaw, where after 25 years he decided to play the role of
  creator again. Part of the *Kisieland* project is a soon-to-be completed film.
  It brings the existing archive into dialogue with a portrait of the current
  Kisiel, who will once again stand face to face with a hired model. Two
  completely different contexts will confront each other. The story will be
  enlivened through the narrative and thanks to the authentic energy coming from
  this unusual meeting.

  The project *Kisieland* is assumed to involve long-term activities, beginning
  with the conversations’ recording, through the process of organizing and
  digitalizing the slides, to making a documentary film, publishing a book and
  presenting various materials in the form of exhibitions. Placing Kisiel’s
  archive in the context of the arts is a chance to restore/reveal but also to
  discover its critical potential. It is also an opportunity to complement the
  Polish visual history with hitherto ignored motifs.
