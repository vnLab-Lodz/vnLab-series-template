  Robert Rauschenberg and Andy Warhol began to incorporate photographic images
  into their paintings, establishing a new mode of art making that relied not on
  the then-dominant tradition of gestural abstraction but rather on mechanical
  processes such as screenprinting. In doing so, they challenged in the notion
  of art as the expression of a singular, heroic author and recast their works
  as repositories for information, be it autobiographical, cultural, or
  historical. This archiving impulse revolutionized art over the ensuing
  decades, paving the way for a conceptually driven use of photography as a
  means of absorbing the world at large into a new aesthetic{" "}

    Wall-panel for “Appropriation and the Archive,” in _Haunted: Contemporary
    Photography/Video/Performance_, Guggenheim Museum, March 26 to September 6,
    2010. An earlier rehearsal of the same airily inflated conception of “the
    archival impulse” had been offered in _Archive Fever: Uses of the Document
    in Contemporary Art_, curated by Okwui Enwezor for the International Center
    of Photography, January 18 to May 4, 2008. This exhibition, described as a
    “widespread investigation” of “the archive as both a conceptual and in
    physical space in which memories are preserved and history decided,”
    centered, in fact, once again, on “works by leading contemporary artists who
    use photographic images to rethink the meaning of identity, history, memory
    and loss.” Artists included Christian Boltanski, Tacita Dean, Stan Douglas,
    Harun Farocki and Andrei Ujica, Felix Gonzalez-Torres, Sherrie Levine,
    Robert Morris, Walid Raad, Thomas Ruff, Fazal Sheikh, Lorna Simpson and,
    inevitably, Andy Warhol.
