# Archive, Storage, Entropy. Tempor(e)alities of Photography

<Author>Wolfgang Ernst</Author>

## On the difference between storage, memory and archive

The archival act is the gesture of setting apart records from the immediate operations of the present called the present, in order to store matter, energy or information for later re-use.

<br />

Against all metaphors of so-called collective memory, the archive is not about remembrance, but a cold administrative and juridical memory. The power of memory now takes place technologically. To resist the hallucinatory temptations of historical and cultural discourse when being in (touch with) the archive is the virtue of the media-archaeological gaze.

<br />

In the spring of 2011 a temporary “Hall of Remembrance” in Japan collected the wet photographs rescued from the ruins of towns destroyed by the recent earthquakes and Tsunami. At the same time, in the United States there is a huge image archive permanently located in Iron Mountain, <Annotation target="Pennsylvania,">See Jorinde Seijdel, “Cold Storage,” _Open_ 2004, no. 7, _(No)Memory_, 66-77.</Annotation> where the Corbis Corporation keeps physical photographs and negatives, withdrawn from use, and commercializes only their digital distribution and rights. In cold technical language, _memory_ is nothing but a metaphor for a form of storage that is not about remembrance, but is simply a function of logistical addresses. The archive is a mnemonic agency in a technological sense, while remembrance is an active energy that drives archival evidence outside the archive. Such memories are functional techniques; their temporal index is arbitrary. What is being retrieved from technical memories is not the past; it is as present as anything else around us. Here, the emphatic notion of the “past” is being replaced by electronic immediacy (_medium_, that is: the “inbetween,” in a radically temporal sense), close to the chrono-logics of neuronal wiring.

<br />

In the mid-nineteenth century, the spreading photographization of the world resulted in massive collections that were soon arranged according to bibliographic <Annotation target="categories.">As expressed by Oliver Wendell Holmes, „The Stereoscope and the Stereograph,“ _Atlantic Monthly_ (June 1859), 733-748.</Annotation> The order of photography oscillated between the archival and the library function, but let us maintain the traditional conceptual and institutional difference between “library”, “archive” and “museum”. A library is free to collect and to select, while the archive – by laws that oblige records to be deposited – is built from regulated input that can only be selected at the threshold of permanent storage. In both archives and libraries, information is organized so that it may be later retrieved. But unlike the open policy of collecting (and selecting) in libraries, archives are strictly “rule governed, administratively programmed <Annotation target="systems.”">Kjetil Jakobsen, _Anarchival Society_, in _The Archive in Motion. New Conceptions of the Archive in Contemporary Thought and New Media Practices_, ed. Eivind Røssaak (Oslo: Novus, 2010), 136.</Annotation>. Should we better speak of libraries of photography, of the “Phototheque”? Archives keep unique, singular records, like Daguerreotypes; libraries keep multiple, mass-reproduced printed documents, like the Talbotype.

<br />

In public discourse and cultural analysis, the notion of the “archive” is closely associated with memory, even with history. But when we look at the genealogy of archives in history itself, they turn out to originate in a instrumental necessity to keep legal claims (of rulers, of states) in latency for action – a kind of _cache_ memory in administration rather than a detached place of cultural memory. Archival closure (inaccessibility being the essence of the archive, as opposed to public libraries) is not only an agency of repressing information, but of protection as <Annotation target="well.">On the ambiguities of such protection, see Friedrich Kittler, “Protected Mode,” in Kittler, _Draculas Vermächtnis. Technische Schriften_ (Leipzig: Reclam, 1993).</Annotation> For the longest time, the politics of the archive have not been primarily aimed at serving collective and cultural memory, but at acting as an internal juridical memory of local or general government. Archives are less concerned with memory than with setting apart records that can be eliminated after their functional usage.

<br />

On the symbolic level (that of organisation) we might ask: What kind of records are kept in the archive in order to be preserved for posterity? Indeed, the power of the archive is less in what it contains but in what has been excluded – a function of the cybernetic door. Around 1800, the philosopher G. W. F. Hegel made a clear analytical distinction between human remembrance (_Erinnerung_) and technical memory (_Gedächtnis_). Let us not face this question primarily on the level of memory discourse, of cultural memory as a function of media representation (which is just the surface appearance of media memory); rather, let us take the media-immanent, media-archaeological perspective. There is a world of difference between (electro-)mechanical storage, that is the world of the symbolic memory (the traditional record archive), and that of imaginary memory (remembrance). The archive is not so much a semantic memory as an organisational form, a well-defined system, a format of symbolic order by meta-dating, a rule that is non-invasive to its material objects.

<br />

Once we cease confusing remembrance with memory, we get access to the archive in Foucault's sense; the emphatic notion of memory itself dissolves into the mechanisms and cybernetics of storage. According to Michel Foucault, “the archive is the first law of what can be said, the system that governs the appearance of statements as unique events. But the archive is also that which determines that all these things said do not accumulate endlessly in an amorphous mass, nor are they inscribed in an unbroken linearity [...]; but they are grouped together in distinct <Annotation target="figures.”">Michel Foucault, _The Archaeology of Knowledge_, (New York: Tavistock, 1972), 129.</Annotation>

## Archival resistance against streaming data

Traditional archival self-consciousness means both spatial and temporal separation from the actual presence, a kind of latency. Such latency provides a temporal shelter (Hegelian _Enthobenheit_) against immediate consumption, a chronotemporal economy and a guarantee against permanent transformation: preserving the _monument_. In sharp contrast to traditional archives, with the World Wide Web, reverberating circuits gain dominance over memory involving records. The Internet is a circulation of discrete records and streaming data, without a central agency or an organized memory. Even the Internet Archive created by Brewster Kahle in California just copies momentary snapshots of the Web; in spite of its name, this is not an archive:

<br />

_And yet something like classical archives are vital to the functioning of the anarchival world. When using a search engine like Google, you are actually not searching the net, you are searching documents that have been crawled, that is compressed, and prefixed in the Google repository by docID, length, and URL, before being indexed according to Google’s famous secret formula _<Annotation target="*[…].*">Jakobsen, _Anarchival Society_, 140. See Sergey Brin and Lawrence Page, „The Anatomy of a Large-Scale Hypertextual Web Search Engine,“ _Computer Networks and ISDN Systems_ 30, no. 1-7 (1998), 107-117.</Annotation>

<br />

Google’s architecture is reminiscent of an archive. But this is not a classical archive any more, but a processual one, with the Page Rank algorithm re-generating the ranking of retrieved information according to statistical and referential values and weighting on a genotypical level. There is still a rule governed, programmed system that organizes information so that it may be retrieved, but unlike the traditional archive, this archival “inventory” is updated – and indeed reconfigured – at an incredible speed: always another archive.

<br />

Considered through the lens of a Deleuzian re-reading of Foucault, the archive presents a kind of diagram. The multi-media archive, more specifically, represents an operative diagram, a diagrammatic machine, still topological in its organisation by graphs and nodes, but with the additional dimension of temporal dynamics. Intermediary electronic archives are increasingly replacing institutional immobile <Annotation target="archives.">See Wolfgang Ernst, “Archive in Transition”, in _Interarchive. Archivarische Praktiken und Handlungsräume im zeitgenössischen Kunstfeld_, ed. Beatrice v. Bismarck et al. (Cologne: Walter König, 2002), 475-484.</Annotation> But when the archive becomes subject to time-critical reconfigurations, it loses its traditional definition as the permanent working memory of a _state_ (in its abstract and concrete sense). When the archive becomes an intermediary memory, it is not separated from but directly coupled to the operative procedures of a given presence, involved in just-in-time and real-time processing, thus tending more to the register (a temporary deposition) than to the end-archive.

## The multiple embodiments of the archive

The Internet has been designed for immediate use; it cannot pay respect to the materiality (thus immoblity and physical resistance) of the traditional archival record. If digital virtualisation and informatization is the signature of current media culture, it is less archival than ever. The old institutional archive served as a bedrock against the complete mobilization of records, as opposed to distributed digital archives with open access in the Internet of today. With intelligent addressing of digital images, an ever transforming set of record retrieval is possible once they exist in mathematicized space: not fixed by meta-data only any more, but in permanent metamorphosis. At that point, the focus shifts from the analysis of traditional archival records (continually represented in the digital world) to the new kind of archive that emerged within the Internet: its <Annotation target="protocols.">See Alexander Galloway, _Protocol. How Control Exits after Decentralization_, (Cambridge, Mass. / London: MIT, 2004).</Annotation> As the old archive has become a mere simulacrum in the digital world and dissolved into dynamic re-ordering, a new “permanent” (or at least stable) archive of rules has emerged.

## Archival authority and photography

Is photography an archival medium at all, or is photography archival by its very nature? Photography relates to the archive in many ways. It is embedded in the archive as part of an extended record function. The archive is embedded in the photograph itself when, for example, photography is used for surveillance practices such as biometric <Annotation target="pictures.">See Allan Sekula, “The Body and the Archive,” _October_ 39 (1986), 55.</Annotation> The archive seems to share its indexical character with photography itself, which might turn out to be a structural analogy. As mathematical functions of the alphanumeric <Annotation target="code">See Vilém Flusser, _Für eine Philosophie der Fotographie_, (Göttingen : European Photography, 1984).</Annotation>, digital photographs can be pixelwise addressed, and thus become an archive in themselves.

<br />

Explaining a photographic plate showing articles of China in his publication _The Pencil of Nature_, Henry Fox Talbot pointed out that a collector’s whole cabinet might be depicted on paper by this technology in little more (exposure) time than it would take him to make a written <Annotation target="inventory.">William Henry Fox Talbot, _The Pencil of Nature_ (London, 1844; reprint New York: DaCapo Press, 1969).</Annotation> Soon after its invention photography was used to extend the archival order. Adapting and modifying Marshall McLuhan's major theses on media culture, the message of the traditional storage agency “archive” has been the typographic world of alphabetic records (the symbolic order of administration), with the discreetness of elementary units privileging analytic reading and classificatory listing. Since the end of the 19th century a new type of record emerged: the recording of physically real signals (indexical photography, phonography and cinematography). These are non-archival media insofar as they do not operate on the symbolic level like the alphabetically coded traditional historical record – at least on the _recto_ side of the photographic print. On the _verso_ side, however, the symbolical regime is indeed usually at work (scriptural marks of all kind). But in digital photography, this dichotomy collapses; signals and meta-data are coupled into one (the MPEG-7 standard). The digital *photo*graphy is not about the physical _light_ signal any more at all. With digital photography, the scriptural “archive” re-turns in a new sense: as the symbolical regime of the alphanumeric code. The completely coded image replaces signals by arbitrary symbols that can be processed (that is, computed) mathematically and algorithmically. A digital photograph or any other document can thus be “altered” without (almost) leaving a trace of such manipulation. The practices of digital media draw our attention to the question of how the authority of information can be established or preserved in a new medium.

<br />

The photographic archive is predominantly a structure, not a pictorial content. Thus it is less about the photochemical evidence than about the data linking the analogue signals to the symbolic regime of discrete codes. On the one hand, photographic authenticity depends on its physical (and semiotic) indexicality. On the other hand, the photograph derives its authenticity from the structure of archival authority itself (which is contextual “situative” authenticity). The culture of digital photography relies on the archival model for its legitimacy in new ways, since the immaterial image itself is not testimony any more.

## Archival times and different tempor(e)alities of of photography

The question of photographic authority is linked to the nature of archival tempor(e)alities indeed. There are conflicting time regimes in the archive: on the one hand, it is meant to suspend time to transfer information for future memory (negentropically); on the other hand, it is subject to time at work (entropic processes, material decay). In a third aspect, the speed of access, migration and short-time memorial functions of the archive increase.

<br />

The “archival time” of immobile photography differs from the temporality of other analog storage media (like phonography and cinematography); electronic media (audio and video tape recording) are time-based in every aspect. Not in the Newtonean, but Maxwellean sense, the (almost) immediate transmission of light (live transmission in “Hertzean” media which are based on electro-magnetic waves) is the reversal of what the permanent registering of light on photographically sensitive emulsions (the photographic negative) embodies.

<br />

According to Roland Barthes, against the discourse of photo-historical knowledge (_studium_), the _punctum_ insists. This photographic _punctum_ is not just metaphysical or affective, but very literally the tracing of light rays that originally operated upon the photographic negative and (by “enlightening” of a second order in the laboratory) were re-produced in the successive prints. The photographic record is the negentropical inscription of one moment of light onto a carrier medium. The analogue physicality of the photographic print (and its cinematographic twin) thus secures its status as historical record.

<br />

In the use of photography as visual evidence from the past, an anarchival moment (which escapes the symbolic order of archive-based historiography) is the signature of photographic time. Described by Walter Benjamin as a genuinely media-archaeological quality, photography occasionally provides for a Proustian _mémoire_ _involontaire_ that escapes all ideological manipulation, as an accidental flash of the real. It is in photography itself – notably in its temporal _momentum_ – that the “auratic” moment resides. The camera lens gives access to other evidence than is usually disclosed to the human eye; thus it opens a different kind of archive of the <Annotation target="present.">Walter Benjamin, “Kleine Geschichte der Photographie,” in _Gesammelte Schriften_ Bd. II/1 (Frankfurt/M.: Suhrkamp, 1972), 371.</Annotation> Benjamin called this the “optical unconscious”, which turns out to be technological. The human spectator learns about such images only by means of photography, especially because the photographic apparatus does not by itself differentiate between the semantically significant and the insignificant in their <Annotation target="referents.">See Volker Wortmann, “Was wissen Bilder schon über die Welt, die sie bedeuten sollen?” in _Authentizität. Diskussion eines ästhetischen Begriffs_ (Munich: Fink), 2006), 163-184 (180).</Annotation> Its non-hermeneutic essence is a media-archaeological virtue (not deficiency) of photography as media technology, coined by Charles S. Peirce as semiotic _index_. This is closer to the signal than to the sign (in terms of the reference), and rather a contingent, pre-symbolic, thus an-archival trace. Talbot was explicit in the introductory words to _The Pencil of Nature_ when he stressed that the photographic plates therein have been (in-)formed by optical and chemical means alone, that is: without the human aid of drawing. Talbot media-archaeologically radicalized the techno-poetic rupture with the rhetoric of iconic mimesis. Photography in this sense is not about image reproduction but about measuring physical light. As expressed by Talbot in 1844, and later re-discovered by Henri Bergson, a picture, divested of the ideas that accompany it, and considered only in its ultimate physical nature, is but a variety of light frequencies and shadows thrown upon chemically sensitive paper. Media theory is split between two very different approaches to this photographic being: media archaeologists describe the non-discursive practices of the techno-cultural archive, while media phenomenologists analyze how phenomena in various media appear to the human cognitive apparatus: to the mind and <Annotation target="senses.">Jakobsen, _Anarchival Society_, 141, referring to Wendy Hui Kyon Chun's introduction to _New Media, Old Media. A History and Theory Reader_, ed. Wendy Hui Kyong Chun and Thomas Keenan, (New York / London: Routledge, 2006), 3f.</Annotation>

<br />

Roland Barthes' notorious identification of the two distinct qualities of photography as perceived by humans, the _studium_ and the _punctum_, can be applied to archival times as well. While the media-archaeological reading of the archive is distancing and biased by the technomathematical analysis (the techno-_studium_), not mistaking storage for memory or even remembrance, the phenomenological reading of the archive corresponds with the _punctum_ when, miraculously, something like a flash crossing and short-circuiting the temporal gap between the record from the past and its present reading happens.

## Timeless? Entropic versus digital photography

Different from the phonographic record, which is a storage medium as well, the photographic print (after having been chemically processed) does not depend on an operative apparatus to articulate its content, but can be processed by human perception immediately without the interference of a technical medium of re-generating the registered signals. It is here that the seductive power of photography in the archive emerges: the referential illusion of historicity, of a past moment “as it actually happened” (Leopold von <Annotation target="Ranke).">See Leopold Ranke's famous phrase on historical method “bloss zeigen, wie es eigentlich gewesen” in the preface to his _Geschichten der romanischen und germanischen Völker 1494-1514_ (Leipzig, 1874), vii. See John Tagg, “Der Zeichenstift der Geschichte,” in _Fotogeschichte. Beiträge zur Geschichte und Ästhetik der Fotografie_ 13, Heft 49 (1993), 27-42.</Annotation> The media-archaeological gaze tries to resist this phantasmagory by looking at the tempo-reality of the medium itself.

<br />

Let us imagine two photographs of a historic building taken with the same camera, but at different times. One photograph shows the unrestored architecture, the other (more recent) shows its renewed state. As a medium, photography is indifferent to the tempor(e)ality of its referent; whatever is inscribed is radically present as a light event. Its historicity lies rather in the entropy of its own physical state. Against this, digital photography is a-temporal, carrying the temporal trace not in the image data (which is its binary essence), but in the hard- and software into which this information is <Annotation target="embedded.">See Wolfgang Hagen, “Die Entropie der Fotografie. Skizzen zur einer Genealogie der digital-elektronischen Bildaufzeichnung,” in _Paradigma Fotografie. Fotokritik am Ende des fotografischen Zeitalters_, Bd. 1, ed. Herta Wolf (Frankfurt/M.: Suhrkamp, 2002), 195-235.</Annotation> Digital photography, based on Charged Coupled Devices, is completely reversible and thus non-historical. Negentropically, digital photography does not _count_ with the historical any more, depriving photographs of their temporal indexicality, by a translation of the image into mathematical, time-invariant topologies.

<br />

Analogue photography by its very materiality inscribes traces of time, whereas in digital photography, the temporal index becomes a stamp, a date without physical evidence of aging. In current media art, the “archaeological” use of anachronistic media like film based on analog photographical <Annotation target="frames">See Malin Wahlberg, “A Relative Timetable. Picturing Time in the Era of New Media,” in _Allegories of Communication. Intermedial concern from cinema to the digital_, ed. John Fullerton and Jan Olsson (Rome: John Libbey, 2004), 93-103.</Annotation> reads like a retro-effect against digital atemporality – an archaic counter-practice, techno-archival resistance.

<br />

The digital photograph preserves the iconic quality while loosing the indexical trace. Or rather, indexicality itself is of a different kind here. While the analogue photographic print keeps a physical trace of the past, recording the light frequencies, the digital pixels maintain a schematic, mathematically abstracted relation to their generating (and then sampled) analogue signals – a diagrammatic (instead of temporal) indexicality.

<br />

At this point, let us remember once more: archives emerged with the symbolical code of writing. Any symbolically coded record can be transmitted (or “migrated”) with a high degree of fidelity in copying, regardless of the material support. Thus the symbolic code (be it the genetic code or the alphabet) esp. in the alphabet, is mostly invariant towards historical, i.e. entropical change. As Norbert Wiener would have it, such data, coded as information, _per definitionem_ are neither matter nor <Annotation target="energy.">See Rudolf Gschwind / Lukas Rotenthaler (interviewed by Ute Holl), “Migration der Daten, Analyse der Bilder, Persistente Archive,” _Zeitschrift für Medienwissenschaft_ 2, no. 1 (2010), 103-111 (104).</Annotation> In 1859 Oliver Wendell Holmes, soon after the popularization of photography, already interpreted photography as information rather than as a material record – a different kind of archive. Holmes comments on a photograph of the cathedral of Nôtre-Dame in Paris: “Form is henceforth divorced from matter. [...] Give us a few negatives of a thing worth seeing, taken from different points of view, and that is all we want of it. Pull it down or burn it up if you please. [...] form is cheap and <Annotation target="transportable.”">Holmes, _The Stereoscope and the Stereograph_, 747. See Jens Schröter, “Die Macht der Stillstellung. Zur technologischen Abtastung und Verfolgung am Beispiel der Fotografie und des Computers”, in _Stillstellen. Medien – Aufzeichnung – Zeit_, ed. Andreas Gelhard, Ulf Schmidt and Tanja Schultz (Schliengen: Edition Argus, 2004), 60-74.</Annotation> The photographic transformation of matter into information changes its tempor(e)ality as well: “Time no longer has physical <Annotation target="meaning.”">Elizabeth Skadden, _Collapsing New Buildings_ (MA thesis, Rhode Island School of Design, no year), 66. This insight has been demonstrated in her media installation _Steenbeck Loop_: “I made 16mm films and became enamored with its ability to express time with a physical presence. Film is measured in feet; it gives time a measure of distance” (ibid.).</Annotation> Digitalising photography in the archives will result in a divided memory world, with some data circulating on the World Wide Web while undigitized photographies remain largely unseen in physical archives.

## Dis/order in photographic archives

Let us finally come to the point where the photographic archive becomes poietic itself, by generating new patterns of making use of digitally stored visual evidence.

<br />

There is a reverse proportional memory economy at work with photographic archives. Physical storage of the photographic print, when professionally conserved, provides a relatively stable enduring memory, but one that is more difficult for the public to access. Once digitized, the electronic image is open to almost real time access and new search options like similarity-based image retrieval; at the same time, the “virtual” essence of the electronic image becomes more fragile and subject to alteration than ever.

<br />

The traditional architecture of the archive is based on classifying records by inventories. This is now being replaced by dynamic order from fluctuation in digital media. But this is no longer an “archive”, but an algorithmically ruled processuality. In such a new configuration, images can not only be retrieved as contained in their frames, but even by their atomic elements (pixelwise). Even that which has not been meta-tagged at all can be retrieved in this way, opening new options of visual <Annotation target="memory.">See Harun Farocki, “Arbeiter verlassen die Fabrik,” _Meteor – Texte zum Laufbild_ Nr. 1 (Dezember 1995), 49-55 (50).</Annotation> Such a distribution of image elements does not belong to the traditional archive any more, but builds up a new, generative principle: an archive in the mathematized sense, based on information itself.

<br />

The nostalgia for archival order is of course a phantasm surviving from the age of print. The alternative is a media culture dealing with the virtual an-archive of multi-media in a way beyond the conservative desire of reducing it to static order again. Instead of thinking the archive in terms of order by classification, we have to think entropically; that is, allowing for a certain amount of disorder, which, according to communication theory, contains a higher measure of possible information. In an 1884 lecture under the title “The Storm-Cloud of the Ninetenth Century”, John Ruskin implicitly replaced the museum-like concept of classification by a theory of an archive _in motion_, a kind of steady-state. Instead of the order of things attributed to culture within the well-known Victorian museums, Ruskin found in the weather a thermodynamic phenomenon that brings forces into play that radically alter ordinary mechanistic representation of nature: a form of order understood as process rather than state. Entropy – the conceptual enemy to the traditional archive as authority of tradition – is thus not just the negation of order but rather its alternative, an organizing principle of disorder that all of a sudden makes sense when observed from a different media <Annotation target="epistemology.">See Harun Farocki, “Arbeiter verlassen die Fabrik,” _Meteor – Texte zum Laufbild_ Nr. 1 (Dezember 1995), 49-55 (50).</Annotation> Such an analysis oscillates between the micro- and the macrophysical level and results in different media-cultural aesthetics.

## Sorting photography at random

Let us therefore imagine “experimental” archives of photography different from the well-organized institutional archive. Digitized images can be transformed into a vast image bank which then as data-set can be unified and subjected to image-based search operations such as matching of similarities, feature detection, statistical colour value compasion etc. Instead of the alphanumeric labeling and keywording of pictures, the development of “fuzzy” computer-sorting will begin to make useful comparisons of similar but not identical images on the basis of new protocols.

<br />

The prosopopoietic, “dialogic” rhetoric of the archive is currently being replaced by operational archival interaction, as illustrated by _Pockets Full of Memories_, originally a museum installation by the media artist George Legrady in which the audience _creates_ an archive by contributing scanned images of objects in their possession at the time of the exhibition visit. The virtual, flexible archive of these images is then organized by a so-called self-organizing map (SOM). This algorithm captures some of the fundamental processing principles of the brain, especially of the experimentally found ordered maps in the <Annotation target="cortex.">Timo Honkela and Juha Winter, “Simulating Language Learning in Community of Agents Using Self-Organizing Maps”, Helsinki University of Technology, Publications in Computer and Information Science, Report A71, December 15, 2003.</Annotation> The _self-organizing map_ is an adaptive semantic memory model which is dynamic and associative – just as envisioned in Vannevar Bush's 1945 vision of a memory-extending apparatus (MEMEX) that follows, not the artificial taxonomies of libraries, but instead the associative indexing as performed in the human brain. The SOM as applied by Legrady is a hybrid of archival classification and automated matching of humanly typed keywords (semantic information) and algorithmic object description, by turning them both into numbers, which is how mathematically determined organization happens. In his more recent, technologically updated version called _Cell Tango_, George Legrady displays a projection of a constantly changing assemblage of photos sent by individual smart phone users, projected over a large screen in a variety of <Annotation target="patterns.">For the data collected, see http://tango.mat.ucsb.edu/pfom/databrowser.php</Annotation> Fresh snapshots swiftly adjust to the mosaic according to formal criteria and their tags, mingling with already taken photos from the photo-sharing website Flickr. The algorithm randomly distributes them, while the space in between is successively filled by smaller incoming photographs. These loosely coupled patterns evolve dynamically – subverting the archive.
