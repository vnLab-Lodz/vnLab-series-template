# The Place of NGOs in Archival Activities

<Author link="/chapter_22">Karolina Lewandowska</Author>

The Archeology of Photography Foundation was launched in 2008 by a few photography enthusiasts in order to take care of archives of Polish photographers that are still in the hands of their heirs and have neither been worked on nor made publicly accessible. The Foundation’s main objective is to organize, describe and promote these archives, while simultaneously managing them in the form of a long-term deposit. When our initial assumptions were confronted with real financial, legal and spatial conditions, we were forced to reflect on how far-reaching this type of non-commercialized activity in the field of the arts could be. Are NGOs capable of collecting, storing and making archives accessible to the public on a regular basis? What is it that they can offer society and what dilemmas are they faced with? It is also worth inquiring – what are the appropriate marketing strategies and methods of elaborating and distributing materials, and what ethical attitude should go along these actions?

NGOs are supposed to take initiative and be active in spheres that are out of the reach of the State. They function on a lower level than the State and are closer to life. The majority of these organizations are small, lacking permanent locations and accustomed to constant re-organization. Even though they don’t have stable budgets, which is sometimes disadvantageous, they are also not limited by the strict legal restrictions that affect national institutions, especially museums and archives. Being much smaller than state institutions and having a less complicated structure, NGOs are more comfortable making independent decisions. All these facts allow them to be flexible and utilize alternative strategies that would be difficult to enact in bigger institutions.

The formation and development of the Archeology of Photography Foundation is proof that NGOs are essential in the field of photography described above. The Foundation was created to respond to a real problem that would be difficult (or even impossible) for institutions reporting to the state to solve. It concerns the situation of privately owned photographic archives. Because the problem of the legacies of photographers is not of great political consequence, there are no clear policies in place to deal with them, and the problem has grown to a sizeable magnitude. Despite the collections being taken over by institutions such as the State Archives, the National Library, the Polish Academy of Sciences or local museums, numerous collections are still owned by the photographers’ inheritors. This means that they are not only hidden from the public, but also that they are doomed to destruction. What is more, it’s impossible to ascertain exactly what they contain. The Association of Polish Artist Photographers (Związek Polskich Artystów Fotografików/ZPAF), an organization whose premises are not particularly spacious, could not suggest a structural solution. Historically, museums have not been interested in maintaining the entire archive of a particular photographer, and most of them still aren’t. Though we may be observing slow changes in this field; the Museum of Modern Art in Warsaw consistently acquires collections in this way, making it a pioneer of the new approach of museums towards artists’ archives. Another exceptional initiative has been taken by people associated with the Academy of Fine Arts Museum,:{{^1}} whereby they agree to organize and digitize an artist’s archives for the artist’s heirs in exchange for permission to make the collections accessible to the public. One of the most recent examples of such operations is the stewardship of the legacy of Henryk Tomaszewski, a distinguished graphic artist and creator of the Polish School of Posters. The works of Ryszard Stanisławski, a world famous critic, curator and long-time director of the Art Museum in Łódź, have similarly been secured for posterity. However, few museums in Poland have a policy of taking on such projects; they are generally considered to be the responsibility of the archives. Indeed, although archives are engaged in collecting the works of selected artists, they do not popularize them, because they do not deal with art per se. Yet, in most cases, inheritors expect special and individual treatment of their collections. They also fear that if they sell or hand over an extensive set of materials to a state institution, they admittedly protect it from degradation, but they also risk losing access to it for extended amounts of time during the lengthy process of its organization and preservation. In addition, they see giving away the archive as losing control over the possibility to redefine – or not redefine – the artist’s output. The family also frequently refuses to part with their collection for sentimental reasons.

The Archeology of Photography Foundation was created to help avoid having significant photographers’ archives remain in situations where they are not taken care of, or are taken care of in an unprofessional manner by the photographer’s family. In such cases, the collection can only be accessed by the small number of curators or researchers who incidentally know about it, and this knowledge can only be passed on through the grapevine. An archive/legacy is an extremely demanding thing, one that can rarely be handled by one person. Even if the stewardship of materials takes a more complex and expanded form, it is necessary to be fully devoted to it, and few people are able to take on such a task. This is why the solution suggested by the FAF seems suitable to everyone. The aim of the Foundation is not only protecting the archives, but also promoting them and presenting them to the public.

The most interesting and complex examples of initiatives taken by the FAF are projects related to the archives of Zofia Chomętowska and Zbigniew Dłubak. Both of them were kept abroad in the countries the artists once emigrated to: Argentina for Chomętowska and France in the case of Dłubak. The latter is a celebrated artist, whose photographs and paintings are housed in the most important museums in Poland, where they were exhibited numerous times up until the end of his life. It seemed that all of his pieces were familiar, even well-known, to Polish audiences. However, once the archive was made complete through the importation of some of his materials that had been in France, it turned out that there was still much to discover, and access to the collection made it possible to conduct reliable and revealing research. What is more, as these two collections were the first to be worked on, they also became the subject of pioneering research on the archive as a theoretical problem. In the first few months of this activity, a photographic project launched by Krzysztof Pijarski entitled *Dłubak – Źródła* (*Dłubak – Sources*) marked one perspective on the kinds of work conducted on a photographer’s legacy. By documenting Zbigniew Dłubak’s archive “before,” i.e. in its initial chaotic order (or rather, disorder), Pijarski marked out his own tracks of interpretation. They are of an quite intuitive character, determined by fascination and pleasure, and resulting from a disordered collection’s seduction by anarchy. The rigorous regime of methodologies typical of archival work and art history studies in this case have been set aside. At present, when once the collection is largely in a state of “after;” having been transformed into an archive locked in grey boxes and grey cabinets, the memory of this extraordinary experience and the pleasure it brought can now be still found in the project *Dłubak – Źródła*. Conducting the archival research in parallel with initiating and accomplishing modern artistic projects within the archives has become the essence of the FAF’s activities. It gave rise to a long-term program, *Żywe archiwa* (*Living Archives*)*,* whose aim is to invite various modern artists to work on selected fragments of the photographers’ legacies currently under the foundation’s care.

The archive of Zofia Chomętowska is a specific case for several other reasons. A large part of it was donated to the Historical Museum of the Capital City of Warsaw in 1979 – it comprised several thousand negatives with photos of the pre-war and ruined capital city (the donation or sale of negatives by the author him/herself is quite rare, which makes this particular situation all the more exceptional). A sizeable portion of the photographs of Polesie – the second important theme for this documentary photographer – was given to a private collector. Already in the year of the donation, the first collection served as a source for a big exhibition, however, no catalogue publication accompanied it. The other part remained completely untouched until very recently. The lack of any comprehensive publication, the absence of Chomętowska in Poland, and the fact that she did not work with photography in Argentina, are responsible for her being almost absolutely unknown, or at best associated with traditional, quasi-pictorial photography. Meanwhile, the actual image is very different. When the FAF began to bring the negatives and albums (with thousands of proofs donated by the inheritors) from Argentina, and began systematically scanning them, unknown photos, which have radically changed the image of Chomętowska’s oeuvre, were gradually revealed. In 2011, after two years of work, having scanned 5,000 negatives and 5,000 positives, and identified part of them, two albums that display and interpret the fragments of this immense collection were published. Chomętowska turned out to be a modern documentary photographer, in part at least filling in the gap in the very modest history of pre-war documentary photography in Poland.:{{^2}}

The Foundation compiles and digitalises collections which quite often is the only way to make them public. No doubt, the same could be done by a state institution, but in large institutions, donations like this one tend to await processing for a long time, because their priorities of digitalisation are not determined by the needs of individual donors. Besides, for many museums and archives, making these collections accessible on a large scale is still not a top priority. The situation is slowly beginning to change, in accordance with the perceived necessity of digitalising photography collections as part of a long-term government strategy, also enshrined in EU directives. A good example is the National Digital Archive, which activated a program called _Search in Archives_, which unifies archival collections into one browser and carefully analyses the numbers of visitors. An analogous program for photography is being prepared now.

The need for the activity of the third sector in the field of archiving is attested to by the fact that NGOs guarantee diversification, which is the basis of democracy. The presence of foundations taking care, even of singular archives, seems very important. Their role is often fundamental, as can be seen, for example, by the activity of the Karta Centre – the oldest Polish organisation of this kind – which was established on the basis of the underground publishing structure. Karta, being relatively independent of the current political situation in terms of its choice of strategies, pursues a program of historical research in an exceptionally responsible manner, respecting the memories of many national, ethnic and religious groups living on the territory of the former and present Poland. Their research is based on documents donated by individuals.

Archival activity in the context of a small institution allows for one more possibility – to preserve the archive in a shape closest to the original one. It is especially important in the case of artistic oeuvres, where an anarchic order at times proves to be the natural order of these collections, and as such shall be respected. In this field one needs to mention the activity of the Foksal Gallery Foundation, which worked on the archive of the Foksal Gallery and also preserved the atelier of Henryk Stażewski and Edward Krasiński and made it public.

In the case of non-governmental organisations, doubts as to the dynamism inscribed in their structure may arise – at least state archives tend to be suspicious of it. Some issues concerning the ethics of their activities, which are regulated and verified by public opinion rather than by legislation, also emerge. The betrayal of this ethics could be a death sentence for a foundation. That is why one should not forget it. What is of utmost importance is the maintenance of the status of an NGO. The question of financing has been discussed for many years, and it still provokes endless debates. In Poland it so happens that a foundation’s income is treated as ethically ambiguous. Yet the system of financing culture from public sources requires the self-financing of at least part of its tasks. The NGOs’ dependence on public money has negative consequences, and in the case of a still immature democracy, it can lead to their politicisation. The direction sketched during the debates in the Congress of Culture in 2009 was clear: the financial independence of any and all cultural institutions should be encouraged. This leads to the managerial model. One should not, however, forget that in the case of foundations dealing with archives, the question of self-financing is very complex.

Archival activity as such is non-profit and at the same time, it is very expensive. According to our experience an NGO operating in this field has several potential ways to develop: firstly, not to develop – i.e. deal with one archive by the simplest means possible; secondly, to develop in a commercial direction – i.e. find a way to start up a business and pursue statutory activity payable on a large scale, e.g. by establishing a photo agency; finally, to develop activity in the direction of specific projects – work on the archive is then only performed according to the needs of particular projects that are much easier to finance than archival work as such. The city council does not include any archival activities in its program of financing NGOs. Another solution that seems interesting (though not very common) is private-public partnership (PPP).

In the case of the field in question, this solution can lead to very interesting results. Such a partnership could solve part of problems faced by both public or local governmental institutions and NGOs. In the field of culture PPP is often called an unused chance – and so it is. Relative financial stability and secure premises granted to a public institution are extremely important. In the case of photography, the crucial thing is to provide appropriate and stable storage conditions for the collection. We could learn from the example of DEXTRA Photo, our Norwegian partners. The private foundation gave its collection to a public institution as a deposit, and sponsors its development and promotion. In the field of photography, which in Poland seems very neglected, such a co-operation could produce excellent results. The National Library, National Museums or big city museums could partly commission the development and promotion of fragments of their collections to NGOs in order to enrich and enlarge the production of exhibitions and publications, which remain very modest in the case of photography. A non-governmental organisation could also participate, or even act as a middleman, in the exchange with individual inheritors. It would guarantee the development and appropriate popularisation of the collection in exchange for free access to viewing it on the web. The PPP in the sphere of culture is a direction we should stop contemplating and begin acting on, developing its models of its operation.
