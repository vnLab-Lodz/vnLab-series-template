# DEXTRA Photo – A Commercial Photo Agency and a Museum Collection

<Author>Tone Rasch</Author>

DEXTRA Photo is a collection of Norwegian, mainly 20th Century, photography, established in 2008. For the time being the photo archive contains pictures from the Norwegian commercial photo studio Knudsens Fotosenter and 17 other collections that Arne Knudsen, the owner of the studio, has acquired over the years. Apart from the photographs, the archive is comprised of documentary movies, a book collection, and cameras as well as photo technical and movie equipment. It is owned by the Sparebankstiftelsen DnB NOR (DnB NOR savings Bank Foundation) and kept at Norsk Teknisk Museum (The Norwegian Museum of Science, Technology and Medicine).

## About Norwegian photo history

In 2008, the book *80 millioner bilder* (*80 million pictures*) was published in connection with an exhibition by the same <Annotation target="name."></Annotation> Both the book and the exhibition showed Norway’s photographic heritage from the non-art field. The exhibition, created by the National Library in Norway and the Preus Museum with help from other museums, libraries and archives, presented 62 series of photographs from various photographers’ and thematic archives, and all the exhibited photos were printed in the book together with an elaborating text.

<br />

The DEXTRA collection was generally not included in the project, because in 2008, when the exhibition was set up, the collection had not yet been moved to the museum. The fact that it was still not readily available for research and public access might be one reason why the collection was not a part of the exhibition and publication. That may also be the reason why neither Knudsens Fotosenter nor its sub-collections were mentioned by another recent presentation of Norwegian photo history that was published in 2007<Annotation target=".">Peter Larsen and Sigrid Lien, *Norsk fotohistorie. Frå daguerreotypi til digitalisering*, Oslo 2007.</Annotation>

<br />

The information about the photographers and the photo studios in this article, unless otherwise noted, is taken from three different sources: the ‘Index of Norwegian photographers and photo collections’ (‘Registre over norske fotografer og fotografiske <Annotation target="samlinger’)">http://www.nb.no/pm/index.php accessed June 20, 2011; the index is a tool, built mainly on the research of photo historical institutions connected to museums, archives and libraries. Most of the photographers within the DEXTRA Photo collection are represented in the index, but with little contextual information. The ongoing research conducted in the collection will obviously change that situation.,</Annotation> Arne Knudsen’s booklet *Visuell kommunikasjon – en kulturarv* (*Visual communication – a cultural heritage*) from 2007, which gives an overview of the photographers in the collection, and the texts written for the exhibition *Through the Lens*, organised by the Norsk Teknisk Museum in 2009.

<br />

## Knudsens Fotosenter

Arne Knudsen (b. 1936) established Knudsens Fotosenter in 1958. He was trained as a photographer by Einar Haming with a craft certificate in 1956, the common education for photographers during these years. Photography was a craft based on an all-around education. Versatility is also characteristic of the Knudsens Fotosenter business. There has not yet been time to do any profound research into the rich material, but some tendencies seem obvious.

<br />

At the end of the 1950s the market for advertising photography in Norway started growing, in response to a rapidly increasing production of consumer goods. In this context several photo studios were established, Knudsens Fotosenter among them. A large part of the pictures in the archive from the 1960s and early 1970s are product photographs. In those years, Knudsens Fotosenter also documented industrial sites like paper mills, the aluminum industry and ironworks. These pictures are especially valuable for a museum of technology, one of the main tasks of which is the documentation of industrial heritage.

<br />

Tourism is also an important part of the archive. There is a topographical archive of Norwegian towns and tourist sites. The motives were used as postcards and calendar pictures during the 1960s and 1970s and are interesting today as a documentation of nature, buildings and transport of the time. The hotel archive documents Norwegian tourist hotels around 1970. Norway experienced an intense growth in tourism in these years and the number of bed-and-breakfasts increased <Annotation target="threefold.">http://www.ssb.no/histstat/sos/sos_077.pdf](http://www.ssb.no/histstat/sos/sos_077.pdf), accessed June 13, 2011.</Annotation> Knudsen’s advertising photography can be seen as related to that expansion of the tourist trade.

<br />

What is more, Knudsens Fotosenter had many special commissions. The Nobel Institute awarding the Nobel Peace Prize, the Royal Castle, and the development of NATO’s bases in Norway can be mentioned. The company did photographic developing and copying of colour photography, and in 1982 Knudsen started the picture agency, which still exists. The pictures in the DEXTRA Photo collection were all taken before 2005.

## Teigens Fotoatelier

Teigens Fotoatelier (1936–2004) was the leading photo studio specializing in the photography of architecture and design in Norway in the mid decades of the 20th century. The studio was established by Karl Teigen (1884–1969). Since 1939, Teigen’s studio is located at the Museum of Decorative Arts in Oslo, now a part of the National Museum. Teigens Fotoatelier became the museum’s regular photographer. 

<br />

Truls Teigen (1933–2001) served as an apprentice with his grandfather from 1948 and got both Norwegian and Danish craft certificates as a photographer in 1954. He is especially appreciated for architectural photography, working with modernist architects like Sverre Fehn and Erling <Annotation target="Viksjø.">Espen Johnsen (ed.) *Brytninger. Norsk Arkitektur 1945–65*, Exhibition catalogue National Museum for Art, Architecture and Design, Oslo 2010. *80 millioner bilder*, p. 352-257.</Annotation> His photos often show the buildings during construction and also the architectural models.

## Sohlberg Foto

In the 1950s Sohlberg Foto was established by Jan Fredrik Sohlberg (1916–79) together with his wife Astrid. In 1959 he started a regular cooperation with the publishing house Ernst G. Mortensen, which published weekly magazines. Jan Fredrik Sohlberg was a businessman, an amateur photographer, and an active member of the Oslo Kamera Klubb and Norsk Selskap for fotografi (Norwegian Society of Photography). In the Mortensen office building at Majorstuen in Oslo he built up a modern photo studio for advertising and fashion photography.

<br />

The development of Norwegian fashion photography can be seen as a part of the expansion of advertising photography. In the early 1960s Sohlberg Foto worked with fashion photography for the women’s magazine *Norsk Dameblad* (*Norwegian Women’s Journal*), emphasizing feminine ideals and combining elegance with a sense of the practical. In 1965 the journal closed down and Sohlberg continued as a photographer for the teenager magazine *Det Nye* (*Novelty*). The readers became younger and the photos bolder, many taken on location outside the atelier in the city or by the <Annotation target="sea.">Tone Rasch, “Making Clothes Desirable, Making Fashion Visible – Images from Sohlberg Foto in the late 1960s”, in Joanne Turner (ed.) *Images in Time*, Bath, to be published in September 2011.

## Frits Solvang

Frits Solvang (b. 1941) learned photography when he was in the military service in Northern Norway in the early 1960s. At that time he was in contact with the Finnish-Norwegian photographer Kåre Kivijärvi, who was famous for his realistic portrayals of fishermen at sea. In 1965 he finished his studies of photography in Stockholm under the well-known photographer Christer Strömholm. In the end of the 1960s he was employed by Knudsens Fotosenter, and in 1970 he established his own business. He became the main photographer at the National Theatre in Oslo for several decades. He has also worked for other theatres like Det Norske Teateret, Oslo Nye Teater and Riksteateret.

## Anders B. Wilse

Anders Beer Wilse (1865–1949) was one of the most important Norwegian photographers in the first decades of the 20th Century. He went to the USA, where he worked as an engineer and a photographer. In 1900 he returned to Oslo and established his photographic studio. Wilsewas a profiled landscape and tourist photographer during the first decades of Norwegian autonomy, when the nation needed a new identity after the end of the union with Sweden. With his photographs, Wilse took part in construing that new “Norwegian” identity. He was also a respected portrait photographer, and active in the photographers’ organization working for the professionalisation of the photography trade. His interest in tourism and outdoor activities can be seen in the tourist pictures that made him famous as well as in his involvement in the Norwegian Tourist Society <Annotation target="(Turistforeningen).">Larsen and Lien, 2007, pp. 110-116.</Annotation>

<br />

Wilse bought Axel Lindahl’s glass negatives from the end of the 19th century. Axel Lindahl can be said to have been a forerunner of Wilse’s work in tourist photography.

<br />

After his death, his pictures were spread between Norsk Folkemuseum, the Maritime Museum (Sjøfartsmuseet), Oslo Museum and the National Library. In DEXTRA Photo there is a big portrait collection, in addition to the hand coloured slides used by Wilse in a series of lectures that he held, and also an album of Axel Lindahl’s tourist photographs from Wilse’s collection.

## Oslo Kamera Klubb

In 1921 Oslo Kamera Klubb (Oslo Camera Club) was founded. The members were mainly amateurs, for whom photography was a hobby. The club was a part of a broad international camera club movement. The organization arranged exhibitions, and the members participated in international competitions. Lectures were held and the members could use the club’s photographic equipment and dark room. Several of the photographers in the DEXTRA Photo collection were active members of the club, which exists until this <Annotation target="day.">Oslo Kamera Klubb’s main archive is at Preus Museum, Horten.</Annotation>

<br />

Four photographers that remained amateurs are also represented in the collection. These are Erland Rygh, Jan Baashuus-Jessen, Sivert Vistaunet and Clarin Vogt, all awarded at various camera club exhibitions.

## Photos from Hadeland Glassverk

In the 20th century, amateur photography became more and more common, while portraits made by professional photographers still remained popular. Expanding editions of newspapers, journals and other publications opened up for a wide use of commercial photography. Thomas Michael Gunther has pointed out that commissioned photography has been poorly treated in the history of photography though it is of primary importance regarding the development of new techniques and widening the scope of the <Annotation target="art.">Thomas Michael Gunther, “The Spread of the Photography” in Michel Frizot (ed.), *A new history of photography*, Köln 1998, pp. 550-580.</Annotation> DEXTRA Photo gives an opportunity to look closer at this genre.

<br />

All these tendencies are reflected in the DEXTRA Photo collection. An example is a series of photographs from the production of artistic glass at Hadeland Glassverk (Hadeland Glass factory) taken by Knudsens Fotosenter, probably in the 1960s. The pictures depict the process of glass blowing, focusing on the designer Willy Johansson (1921–1993), a prominent representative of Scandinavian Design in Norway. They express a positive attitude towards the craft, characteristic of the time. We can see the designer in different roles: drawing, and looking at the artifact that he has designed himself; he is also depicted as part of a fellowship of other designers and craftsmen at the glass factory. Although the pictures were a commissioned job, they do give insight into many aspects of Norwegian life and culture of that time, and the many possible ways of looking at those series in the abundant collection might reveal interesting views on Norwegian photo history.

## Ownership and management

So far in this presentation I have concentrated on the various photographers that constitute the DEXTRA Photo collection today. In addition to that, the collection comprises photographic and movie equipment, like cameras, projectors and enlargers. There is also a collection of documentary and advertising movies, mainly from the 1960s, and a collection of books and periodicals from the same period. Both the number of objects and their volume are immense and demanding as regards storage and systematic registration. The Sparebankstiftelsen DnB NOR (DnB NOR savings Bank Foundation) has entered into an agreement with the Norwegian Museum of Technology, Science and Medicine, stating that the collection will be deposited at the museum for at least 50 years, until 2058, making the museum responsible for its preservation.

<br />

The Norwegian Museum of Science, Technology and Medicine in Oslo, where the DEXTRA Photo collection is stored, is the principal technological museum in Norway. It was founded in 1914 and photographic technique has been an important part of the museum’s collection since the 1920s. The museum also has a considerable photo collection of approximately 300 000 pictures, mostly from Norwegian industry and communication from the 1890s to 1950s. The museum is not a governmental organization but a private foundation, mainly financed by the cultural department. In that way, the owner and the manager of the DEXTRA Photo collection are both non-profit foundations, though the finance models are different. There are common understandings for the need for preservation, as well as the wish to present pictures to a broader public.

## The first year

In 2008 the collection was moved from Arne Knudsen’s home to the museum. The purpose was not to lose in the transfer the historical character of the collection, enabling research on the older collections Knudsen had bought. Therefore the original structure of the collection was preserved by keeping the sub-collections like they were stored at Arne Knudsen’s home.

<br />

In April 2009 the museum organised the exhibition “Through the lens”, presenting the collection. As there had been no time to do a profound examination of the collection, the exhibition was meant to present samples rather than a thoroughly prepared conclusion of the collection’s content. Both photographs and photo technical devices were exhibited. Photos from Knudsens Fotosenter constituted the main part, presenting different stages in the history of the studio as well as different categories of commissions.

## Preservation and storage

Photographs that were owned by private collectors or originally stored at the photographers’ studios are usually not preserved according to museum standards for packing material and storage conditions. This is also the case with the photos in the DEXTRA Photo collection. Though the museum has storehouses for its own collection these were too small to include the new artifacts and pictures. In the end only the book collection was placed on site in the museum’s library, and two new storehouses were built: one for the cameras and photography equipment and one for the photographs themselves. The new storage units have low-oxygen air-conditioning and the one devoted to photographs also has a steady low temperature and relative humidity. The new magazines offer bettered storage facilities for the DEXTRA Photo collection as well as for the museum’s photo collection. The bank foundation’s ownership as an extra financing institution has therefore improved the condition of the museum’s own collection.

<br />

Acid neutral packing material is important for good storage and the extended lifetime of photographs. The nitrate and acetate filmstrips and sheets are particularly sensitive to climate change and the photos will quickly deteriorate under bad conditions. The intention is to repack all the material, but we realize that this will take time. Photographic material in bad shape is our first priority.

## Digitalization

Another way of preserving the photos is by digitalization. If a photograph is in danger of being damaged, the motif can be saved by digitalization. The photos will often fade over time and a reproduction will preserve the motives for posterity. The bank foundation has provided the museum with the appropriate equipment.

<br />

Digitalization is also important for the presentation of the collection. It is the basis of the digital catalogue, where metadata is attached to the digital file giving meaning to the motive and the historical context of the picture, and describing the material aspect of the object. The catalogue is published at the website [www.digitaltmuseum.no](http://www.digitaltmuseum.no/). This website presents the catalogues from 28 Norwegian <Annotation target="museums.">The number of Norwegian museums in Digitaltmuseum in June 2011.</Annotation> A European cooperation through the website [www.europeana.eu](http://www.europeana.eu/) is also in preparation. Through the website the public can look at the pictures and read about them. Downloading the photos for private use or school work is free. Professionals intending to publish pictures can contact the museum through the digital museum or the museum’s website and use the pictures for a fee.

## Cooperation projects

The DEXTRA Photo collection wants to cooperate with other institutions to present the photos to a larger audience. There has been cooperation between the collection and the Institute of Art History at the University of Oslo regarding the collection from Teigens Fotoatelier. The Art History Institute has scanned parts of this collection in high resolution. Architecture photography from the period 1945 to 1965 was of special interest. Some of the pictures have been used in students’ theses, while other pictures were shown at an exhibition called “Breaking – Norwegian Architecture 1945–65” (Brytninger – Norsk arkitektur 1945–65) held at the National Museum for Art, Architecture and Design in <Annotation target="2010–11.">See note 5.</Annotation>

<br />

Another important cooperation has been between the DEXTRA Photo Collection and The Archeology of Photography Foundation in Poland. The project was initialized by the archive in Warsaw and is supported by the EEA – Norway grant mechanism. The project has different aspects, like creating Internet exhibitions and doing presentations of the collections. For the DEXTRA Photo collection it has been an incentive to present selected parts of the collection together with the Polish archive. Four Internet exhibitions were presented during 2011, showing photography from the different categories of fashion, industry, leisure and dwellings. There has also been a booklet written presenting the two organizations in Poland and <Annotation target="Norway.">Karolina Lewandowska and Karolina Puchala-Rojek, *Fotorejestr*, Warsaw 2011.</Annotation>

## Further plans

Knudsens Fotosenter is a commercial photo agency. This activity is supposed to be continued. DEXTRA Photo is not only an archive stored at a museum, but shall be active and visible. In addition DEXTRA Photo’s aim is to be self-supporting. The incomes from the historical pictures are expected to be led back to the collection and used to improve it. After the first three years of the collection’s existence it is hard to say what DEXTRA Photo will mean for the museum in the long term. Without a doubt, the various kinds of photos represented enrich the focus on photography within the museum both thematically and in terms of preservation.
