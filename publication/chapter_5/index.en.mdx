The discussion around archives and art generally views the archive as an institution founded on order and systematic storage. This view neglects to take into account the many different ways in which disorder and even destruction may affect not only what the archive stores, but even its material substratum and its media. An archive is always faced with threats of disorder from both inside and outside, from floods and fire to other forms of disaster and decay. Such destruction extends not only to analogue archives, but also to digital ones. In digital databases, the degradation or even loss of information may be due, for example, to the rapid aging of storage formats, or to the transfer from one recording technology to another. The question, then, is whether disorder and destruction, rather than affecting the archive from without, might be considered intrinsic to its operations (Freud seemed to think so, as Jacques Derrida has <Annotation target="explained).">Jacques Derrida, _Archive Fever. A Freudian Impression_ (Chicago: University of Chicago Press, 1989).</Annotation>

<br />

A term that is often mentioned when it comes to the relationship between archives and disorder is entropy. The term entropy was coined in 1865 by the German physicist Rudolf Clausius. Derived from Greek _τροπή_ [tropē] (turn, inconversion), it describes a system’s tendency towards spontaneous change and, more generally, the natural tendency of things to disorder. For instance, under certain circumstances (say, in water) a structured compound such as sugar may require more energy to maintain its organization than to disperse its molecules.

<br />

Part of the 2nd law of thermodynamics, which was formalized at the very same time as the modern archive as machinery for the symbolic registration of time came into being, entropy is crucial for understanding historicism. Historicism conceives of history as a series of aggregate states, and of the historian as someone for whom the archive represents the equivalent of an archaeological site, whose various layers allow him to access the past as a series of consecutive, if not necessarily connected, layers.

<br />

In a sense, it is the first law of thermodynamics, with its assertion that in a closed system energy can neither be produced nor destroyed but only changed from one aggregate state to another, that is the most glaringly “archival.” However, it is the second law – according to which the entropy of an isolated system always increases inexorably, dissipating energy – that comes closest to the historicist understanding of time. Entropy, in this understanding, is a way of measuring the different aggregate states – especially the beginning and the end stage – that a closed system can occupy over a specific period of time. Disorder describes nothing more and nothing less than energy’s shift from one aggregate state to another, and the loss of energy that accompanies such a shift (any use of energy is accompanied by entropy).

The only systematic inquiry into the relationship between art and entropy was carried out by Rudolf Arnheim. Perhaps the most important insight Arnheim brings to the relationship between art and entropy is that entropy is not the same as disorder. The association of entropy with disorder can be traced back to Ludwig Boltzmann’s attempt to interpret entropy statistically. In the sense in which Boltzmann used the term, maximal entropy represented a state of maximal disorder, while minimal entropy was a state of maximal order. However, as Arnheim points out, messiness or disorder are not necessarily good examples for a final thermodynamic state. In his essay he gives the example of a child that messes up its room: “The child may have succeeded in breaking all the functional and formal ties among his implements by destroying the initial order and replacing it with one of many possible, equally arbitrary arrangements. Thereby he may have increased the probability that the present kind of state may come about by chance, which amounts to a respectable increase of entropy. He may even have dispersed the pieces of a jigsaw puzzle or broken a fire engine, thereby extending disintegration somewhat beyond the relations among complete objects to include the relations among <Annotation target="parts.”">Rudolf Arnheim, *Entropy and Art. An Essay on Disorder and Order* (Berkeley/CA: University of California Press, 1971), 11.</Annotation> But despite all this, the disorder created by the child is not a very efficient way of randomizing the atoms in his room. For maximum effect he would have had to “grind his belongings to a powder of independent <Annotation target="molecules.”">Ibid.</Annotation> Instead, more or less isolated zones of order exist everywhere within the disorder of the child’s room. As Arnheim points out, only in this sense can we call the child’s room disorderly: “Disorder is not the absence of all order but rather the clash of uncoordinated <Annotation target="orders.”">Ibid.</Annotation>

<br />

Order is what Arnheim calls “an improbable arrangement of elements” – say: the even way in which molecules are held together in a medical pill – while disorder (entropy) is the destruction of such an improbable arrangement – say, when the same pill dissolves in water as its molecules arrange themselves in new ways. It is important to realize that this statement says nothing about the structure of such a new arrangement. As Max Planck writes, pure thermodynamics “regards all substances as absolutely <Annotation target="continuous.”">Ibid., 13.</Annotation> Also, a system that has a high degree of entropy can at the same time be perfectly ordered. This limits the usefulness of entropy for the analysis of bureaucratic archives, where disorder is generally understood structurally.

<br />

It was Boltzmann’s statistical approach to entropy – the effort to predict/measure the number of microstates a certain system can occupy – that became crucial for the use of entropy in information theory (Wiener, Shannon). Here, order – an improbable/unlikely arrangement of elements – is defined as information (information is what is not easily predictable). In other words, information is the opposite of entropy, if by entropy we mean the dissolution of an improbable – orderly – state, suggesting a higher degree of probability.

<br />

To transmit a message full of information is thus to induce order (increased improbability, the opposite of entropy): “The less likely an event is to happen, the more information does its occurrence <Annotation target="represent.”">Ibid.</Annotation> As Arnheim makes clear, the approaches of information theory and entropy are to a certain extent contradictory, because unlike information theory, entropy is not concerned with sequences or a series of elements. To the information theorist, the least structured series – the series with the highest degree of improbability, and hence the one that contains the most information – may at the same time be the most orderly (information equals order). Conversely, the entropy theorist is not concerned with series of individual items or elements, only with aggregate states and how these may add up to form macrostates.

I want to shed light on the relationship between art and entropy with reference to the work of two media artists, Antoní Muntadas and George Legrady. In their work both artists critically engage the (mass) media that network and disseminate information, intersecting in various ways with archives and databases and their truth claims. More specifically, both artists question and critique the traditional understanding of the archive as a stable repository of knowledge. In Legrady’s installation _Pockets Full of Memory_, which was first exhibited at the Centre Pompidou in 2001, visitors were invited to archivize their possessions by scanning and describing them. This information was stored in a database and organized by an algorithm as objects of similar value were placed near each other on a two-dimensional map. This map, which was also accessible online, was then projected into the gallery space.

<br />

What emerged from these activities was an annotated, self-organizing collection of objects that consisted of objects that museum visitors carried with them, including such common items as phones, keys, toys, clothing, personal documents, currency, reading material, etc. The size of the scanning box was the only limiting factor that determined what could be added. Crucially, the archive that is the installation _Pockets Full of Memory_ did not preexist the objects deposited in it. Instead, its structure and organization were an effect of the interactions on the map. Consequently the archive’s organization changed continuously as more objects were added.

<br />

The digital 2D map consisted of 280 objects selected from the total database using the Kohonen self-organizing map algorithm. The ordering of the objects was based on how the audience described them through the touchscreen questionnaire. The map of objects continuously organized itself until the end of the exhibition, and the configuration of the final map was a consequence of all the different transactions and registrations over the entire lifespan of the show. The map is a vivid illustration of Arnheim’s contention that entropy is not the same as disorder: in one sense, the map is nothing but a reflection of the chaotic and messy coincidences produced by random visitors who empty their pockets. And yet, such randomness and disorder, as the map demonstrates, is not without structure, even as that structure continuously evolves over time.

<br />

The key to the continuous evolution of _Pockets Full of Memory_ is context: as new objects are added to the database, providing for new relationships and constellations, its structure changes accordingly. Context also plays a central role in Antoní Muntadas’ work with the archive. By contextualizing the information he works with – by showing that no archive can remain unaffected by the context in which it operates – Muntadas demonstrates that there is no such thing as universal information; there is only (particular) information in specific formats and contexts, and tied to equally specific modes of emission and reception. In these variegated contexts and technical conditions, information is subject to the possibility that its own integrity may be under the threat of entropy.

Muntadas is specifically interested in archives with a high degree of disorder and sudden changes, archives that challenge our assumptions that the knowledge stored in archives is immune to change, or that it can even be conceived of outside of the dynamic process of its transmission or translation. With Muntadas it is often a matter of combining the hardware of the archive with documentary material that is in flux, or whose aggregate state is subject to sudden, unforeseen changes. Often such changes occur as a result of information being transmitted between a sender and an addressee. This can take many forms; from the way that translations change a text to the noise generated by television emissions, or even the transmission of information from our sense organs to the brain. In all these different instances of information transfer, the channels along which the information travels do not function as neutral carriers that remain unaffected by what they deliver. Instead the process of transmission itself becomes an inalienable part of the message it transports. As Muntadas himself has said, how

<br />

> we read […] information […] has to do with our subjective and objective processing of the information as we encounter it. The nature and volume of the transmission, and of our reception, along with our cultural, historical, and space/time conceptions affect our determination of the character of the <Annotation target="message.">Antoní Muntadas, _Personal/Public Information_ (exhib. Cat., The Vancouver Art Gallery, March 16-April 16, 1979), 7.</Annotation>

<br />

The gap that separates the emission of a message from its reception was the focus of the video installations _Emisión/Recepción_ (1974) and _The Last Ten Minutes_ (1976–77). In the latter work Muntadas presented a simultaneous playback of the last minutes of evening television programs from three different countries. This change in the aggregate state of information – from television to tape – directly affected the program’s message. As a result of these and similar changes – for instance, in the wake of a change in the recording format – the archive sheds its air of transparency and readability, becoming opaque and potentially unreadable.

<br />

In the early 1920s, the physicist (and father of the Manhattan project) Leó Szilárd developed a theoretical model that linked heat engines with information engines, establishing a connection between thermodynamics (the manipulation and transfer of energy) on the one hand, and information, on the other. In his paper “A Mathematical Theory of Communication” (1948) Claude Shannon took up Szilárd’s idea, arguing that the transmission of information (“bits”) is never a straightforward process, but one that involves the possibility of disorder, degradation, or even loss, as data makes its way through a noise-filled communications channel. Muntadas provides a succinct illustration of this in _The Message_ (2001), one of the works from the _Translation_ <Annotation target="cycle.">_Translation_ is the title of a multi-faceted series of works with which Muntadas has been engaged since 1994.</Annotation> The artist Claudia Cannizzarro forwarded Muntadas an e-mail message with the subject line: “atto politico.” However, the value of this political act was difficult to establish, as the forwarded message contained only noise, an illustration of the fact that the successful transmission of information, especially where it involves compression, always has to contend with increased entropy, i.e., with the possibility that part (or even all) of its content may be lost. This, Muntadas seems to suggest, does not preclude the possibility for a political act to come into existence. What it does mean, however, is that we should not equate political acts with full transparency and uncompromised readability. Just as noise can be subversive, so can the dynamic processes that favor the process of transmission/compression over transparent reading.

In another work from the _Translation_ project, _El aplauso_ (Bogota, 1999), Muntadas alternates a projected color image of an audience clapping its hands with (b/w) images of violence from the drug conflict in Colombia. These latter images, placed in between the two images of applause, change at such a rapid pace that the viewer can hardly see them (Muntadas used a similar technique in the installation _This Is Not an Advertisement_, 1985). The ephemeral presence of these images upsets the triptych-like symmetry of installation and injects into it a disquieting element of unpredictability. Here as elsewhere, Muntadas’ disruption of an established (image) regime returns unpredictability to information. Consequently, the value of this information can only be measured by our own inability to prepare for its appearance.

<br />

In an illuminating essay about _El applauso_, José Ignacio Roca has explained that the Colombian media formed a habit of packaging the frightening unpredictability of life in Colombia by producing presentation formats that reduced this situation – and the drug wars more generally – to utterly predictable elements of a never-changing series of entertainment: “[*El aplauso*] shows up the treatment of violent events by the local media and the passive and cynical attitude they have generated in the <Annotation target="audience.”">José Ignacio Roca, “Muntadas, ‘On Translation: El aplauso’”, Muntadas, _On Translation_ (exhib.cat. Museu d’art contemporani de Barcelona, no year), 172.</Annotation> In essence, this attitude amounts to draining images of any information whatsoever. In his installation Muntadas increases the amount of information channeled by the system by “hacking” into it. The artist seeks to reinject information into the existing system by returning to its well-ordered normalcy a palpable sense of disorder. Unlike the numbing monotony associated with the clapping scene, such disorder (entropy) is sudden and unpredictable; while not necessarily unstructured, it shatters the symbolic order in which we make ourselves comfortable.

<br />

_El aplauso_ and other works show that the reduction of information/unpredictability that is a hallmark of our mass media (Muntadas: “Shows are presented by the producers, managers, conductors, etc., through packaging […] to submerge the audience in a conscious/unconscious state of leisure. […] The audience is then trapped and <Annotation target="consumed”)">Muntadas. _On_ _Translation_, 167.</Annotation> is but a thin veneer of ordered sense over an abyss of violence and chaos. Far from being a bastion of stability that ensures that messages can reach their sender in an unadulterated form, the ordered sense we associate with “messages” is threatened by this unpredictability at its very core.

<br />

Entropy – a change in the aggregate state of information – affects Muntadas’ work with stored knowledge at every level. His best-known work _File Room_ (1994) – a hybrid installation that blurs the line between office, archive, and database - grafts the digital storage of information onto old-fashioned earlier 20th-century office hardware (filing cabinets). Black filing cabinets – some of them containing computers with their screens in the front - surround a computer workstation at the center of the installation, making the room even darker except for the light from the computer screens themselves. The central computer – like its satellites in the cabinets – is linked to an interactive database collecting instances of censorship from all over the world. In this file room, the analogue cabinets are already empty – archive technologies change over time – and the information they once may have contained in the form of paper files has migrated to a new digital platform. As a location or an archival site, _File Room_ is already much closer to a computer screen than to an actual office situation: the archive as virtual interface.

<ViewportImage

></ViewportImage>

_File Room_ once again presents us with an instance of transfer and translation – from the digital information to the analog files hinted at in the filing cabinets - and hence with the possibility that information may be lost (or garbled) in the process. The presence of two different storage technologies – the computer and the filing cabinet – at the center of the work allegorizes the difficulties involved in any transfer of information from one medium to another, or from a sender to an addressee. And they hint that “censorship” – here understood broadly as the loss of information – is not only a deplorable political practice in many parts of the world, but also part and parcel of the technical operation we call communication.

<br />

In _The Bookstore_ (2005), the change in the aggregate state of information involves the deconstruction of the traditional understanding of archives as systems that remain impervious to what they contain. In this work Muntadas pits an 18th-century model of the representation of knowledge – one that is based on stable categories that subsume heterogeneous pieces of knowledge under them – with the 20th-century critique of that model. As part of the project, the artist visited several bookstores in the US and Britain and took photographs of the signs that guide visitors to the various categories of books (“Art”; “Science Fiction”; “Games”; etc.). In his presentation of these photographs, Muntadas confronted the abstract stability of the universal categories under which the books were grouped at the stores with the utter heterogeneity of the book formats subsumed under them. The montage-like clash between these two elements translates visually into the confrontation of a grid – the basic form of an archive conceived as an empty container – with the messy contents of the images of which it is composed. The 18th-century archive of universal knowledge, Muntadas seems to argue, has to contend with the inescapable entropy of what it tries to contain.

<br />

In his action-based work from the early 1970s, Muntadas focused on other instances of information transfer, notably on the transfer of information from our sense organs to the brain. In several instances this involved the isolation of certain sense perceptions. In actions such as _Smelling Areas_ (1974); _Manipulables_ (1971); _Collective Experience No. 3: Smell, Touch, Taste_ (1971) or _Subsensorial Actions_ (1971–72), he had individuals interact with an object or environment through their senses. In each case the object or environment was purposefully selected by the artist, and the individuals who participated in the action had one or several of their sense organs covered. By isolating specific channels for the transmission (“transcription”) of sensory information, Muntadas temporarily freed them from the domination of the “higher” senses of seeing and hearing. For example, the participants might have their eyes and ears closed off, so that they relied solely on their sense of touch for the exploration and identification of the object (or objects) they confronted. In the case of _Experience No. 3_, 13 people – all of them blindfolded – explored an enclosed space with their hands and feet (groping as a form of knowledge acquisition). The point of these exercises was less the identification of an object than its production as an integrated _Gestalt_ in a multi-tiered process of transcription/translation over time. Of course, such transfers of information – from the object to the hand and then to the brain – are subject to multiple misreadings, and once again it is this entropic element – disorder thwarting all attempts at systematic recognition – that interested Muntadas most of all. Here, as in other projects, Muntadas subjects the concept of information – understood as a heightened state of symbolic order – to a rigorous critique. More specifically, Muntadas asks the question to what degree information – its production, transmission, and reception – relies on the very states of entropic disorder whose repression produces what we call information in the first place.

The anti-retinal impulse behind Muntadas’ early works points to the Duchampian strain of early 20th-century art with its rejection of “the retinal” as art’s primary domain. However, with Muntadas it is less a matter of simply rejecting visuality than of giving non-visual sense perceptions such as smell, touch, and taste “the same opportunity for development as the audio-visual <Annotation target="senses.”">Muntadas, _Proyectos/Projects_ (exhib. cat. Fundación Arte y Tecnología, Madrid, September-November 1998), 156 (Translation mine, S.S.).</Annotation> A crucial part of this increased emphasis on the “lower” senses is the slowing down of the perceptional process; by temporarily freeing them from the domination of sight or hearing, Muntadas forces his participants to take detours, groping around for an object or environment whose specific contours defy easy (visual or verbal) summary. In a manner reminiscent of Bataille, Muntadas reformats our culturally encoded predisposition to view eyesight (and, correspondingly, reason and intellect) as the privileged organs of a body organized along a vertical axis and freed, ideally, from the effects of entropy. At the same time we become aware that perception does not capture its object in an instant, but relies instead on a series of steps whose integration _produces_ the perceived object as an object of our imagination. (In the history of science it was Freud who speculated already early in his career that sensory perception proceeds in different stages or “registrations” – each corresponding to different memory resources in the human brain – that function like <Annotation target="“transcriptions”).">See for instance Freud’s early paper “Five Stages of Perception” (1896), in _The Complete Letters of Sigmund Freud to Wilhelm Fliess 1887–1904_, ed. J. M. Masson, (New York: Grove, 1985), 207-215.</Annotation>

<br />

Muntadas retraced such a “memory process” – remembering not as instant recall but as a series of translations or transmissions – and its technical preconditions in _Media Sites/Media Monuments_ (1982), a series of 14 photomontages that each consist of two images. The first is a color snapshot of a building or street in Washington D.C.; the second, a smaller black and white press image that references a media event that occurred in that same place. In one sense, _Media Sites/Media Monuments_ is about the way in which the information distributed by the mass media inhabits sites formerly occupied by personal memories. In the media age, press photographs inhabit spaces formerly associated with personal experience and with more direct forms of witnessing. In the media age we have never directly witnessed most or all of the historical events we “remember.”

<br />

Muntadas created an allegory of this situation in a work entitled _Acción/Situación: HOY_ (1975–76), confronting an illuminated row of printed newspapers hung very accurately on a wall with the live breathing of the artist in the background, as if to illustrate the modern disparity between information, on the one hand, and more embodied forms of testimony and witnessing (what Walter Benjamin might have referred to as storytelling) on the other.

In _Media Sites/Media Monuments_, the transformation of media sites (sites, that is, at which media-covered events occurred) into media monuments happens through montage: by inserting the b/w press images into the larger snapshot, Muntadas creates a monument not so much to a historical event as to the imaging techniques (framing, cropping, shifts in perspective, etc.) that helped produce it.

<br />

In a 1973 interview with Alison Sky (“Entropy Made Visible”), Robert Smithson linked entropy to our desire for destruction and spectacle: “Well, that may be something that’s human… that’s human need. It seems that there’s almost a hope for disaster you might say. There’s that desire for spectacle. I know when I was a kid I used to love to watch the hurricanes come and blow the trees down and rip up the sidewalks. I mean it fascinated me. There’s a kind of pleasure that one receives on that <Annotation target="level.”">*The Writings of Robert Smithson. Essays with Illustrations*, ed. Nancy Holt (New York: NYU Press, 1979), 196.</Annotation> Entropy is no longer simply understood here as a natural event – the “natural” tendency of a system towards disorder – but rather as the way in which desire frames such an event for us, endowing it with pleasure and turning it into a spectacle we watch as if it were, say, a film. This operation is no longer natural; it follows a technical protocol whose coordinates may differ from case to case. As it assimilates entropy to the symbolic order, such a protocol (say, film) deprives it of its power to disrupt signification and the symbolic order more generally. And perhaps this is the point of *Media Sites/Media Monuments* as well: to show how the media place our desire for catastrophe – for spectacle – in the position formerly occupied by entropy through the tactical (technical) use of images.
