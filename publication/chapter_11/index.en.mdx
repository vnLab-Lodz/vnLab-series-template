# Documentary Photography and the Archive

<Author link="/chapter_22">Iwona Kurz, Wojciech Wilczyk</Author>

**Iwona Kurz: <br />The present discussion will focus on several projects by Wojciech Wilczyk. To me, they constitute an interesting starting point for a reflection on the archive and documentary photography in the context of the current situation, which I would like to describe as the archive’s “bipolar disorder.” Its symptoms can be clearly observed in the actual debates on archives and archiving. On the one hand, there is a growing “archive fever;” an intensified call to preserve everything, a belief in the order and reliability of classification – and, as a result, the description of reality – supposedly provided by archives. On the other hand, there is a sense of helplessness, even fear, related to the magnitude of archival resources, a distrust of the archive’s (seemingly) oppressive modernity, and a dread of entropy. Archives undergo self-destruction, succumb to the immanent decay of matter as such – as was powerfully displayed by Bill Morrison in his film *Decasia* (2002) – but they are also destroyed (closed, blocked) from the outside, due to political or social factors. The latter issue is especially pressing in our part of the world; the organizers of this conference, for example, declare in the catalogue that “post-socialist Central Europe continues to face the need to work through its 20th century history.” Thus, we are constantly working on the subject, yielding to the obsession of memory and the work on it, incessantly confronting either the disbelief towards archives (and their content) or the absolute belief in them.**

**Another important issue connecting photography and archive is a problem resulting from their temporality. The institution of archive is anachronistic by definition. It either reaches into bygone times, including testimonies and records of the past, directing us backwards, or it is dedicated – at the moment of its creation – to the future, to the possible future usage of its content, to “posterity” and “heritage.” For instance: taking someone’s fingerprints is accompanied by the assumption that they will be of some use in the future. Similarly in photography: despite the credited ability to pinpoint “the here and now,” it is often commonly used in an anachronistic way. Each smile at the camera is an act against the documentary meaning of photography, for one does not smile to record well-being, but to evoke a good mood in the future, when looking at the photos. This anachronistic feature of both documentary photography and the archive requires consideration, for it is often here that we will find the very core of the archival message.**

**The last issue that I would like to underline in this introduction is the question of various attitudes towards the archived (documented) reality; of decisions regarding the selection – and display – of events that will prove to be “useful,” or serve as a metonymy of a certain reality (showing the world according to the chosen method). On the one hand, one risks creating a catalogue of curiosities; bizarre people and things. On the other, it happens that the employees of existing archives scavenge and choose material that confirms certain assumptions and opinions, proves them, illustrating required narratives. One can give as an example the body of photographs depicting the Warsaw Uprising. Nowadays they are accessible in digital form, mostly on the website of the Warsaw Rising Museum. There are also some detailed albums on the subject. Such accessibility, enabled by digital databases, serves as an alibi or as legitimization of the fact that only a dozen or so images – those portraying a narrative of youthful insurrection – reappear in public circulation. (_Nota bene_: the category of accessibility in the era of the photographic surplus and multiplication – as in case of the National Digital Archives collection – will require a reconsideration.) Another risk arises from the urge to aestheticise and sentimentalise, often founded on the authority of Roland Barthes. An oversimplified interpretation of his book invokes a naive belief that one can enter the past, enter – if not the soul – then at least someone else’s shoes, and experience an epiphany of sorts as a result of intensely gazing at a photograph.**

**I do believe that all of these issues should be taken up in the context of the work of Wojciech Wilczyk.**

**Wojciech Wilczyk:** <br />Firstly, I would like to emphasize the fact that I have never been keen to create projects “to be watched with pleasure after years”. The photographs I would like to start with are part of my first larger work – *Silesia in Black and White* – devoted to the industrial areas of Upper Silesia. The visual inspiration for this project – carried out in the years 1999–2003 – was drawn from the archive. What I have in mind are very specific archives: a gigantic number of images from the Farm Security Administration collection, preserved in the Library of Congress in the United States, and the photographs taken for the equally massive Standard Oil Project. In both cases, the team of photographers was led by Roy Emerson Stryker.

Thus, I was inspired by black-and-white photos from the 1930s and 1940s that documented the situation of farm workers during the Great Depression, inhabitants of rural towns and industrial regions. It turned out that the pictures that were the most important to me were the ones by Tod Webb: they enabled me to look at Upper Silesia in a different way. They were taken in 1948 in Pittsburgh, an industrial centre, which was nicknamed as “Steel City” or “Smoky Town” at the time. It is located in a mountainous area. At the end of the 19th century a number of ironworks and steel plants were located there, and they contributed to the considerable devastation of the local environment. Webb’s images enabled me to perceive Upper Silesia as a subject of photography, but this inspiration was of even greater consequence. Why was it so? Recently, looking at the photos from *Silesia in Black and White* I realized that the convention of representation that I had adopted – and which was, at the time, a natural, objective and indisputable thing to me – limited the thematic range of the project. Ten years ago the region of the Upper Silesia witnessed the closure of industrial works, mostly ironworks, mines and coking plants. This process caused, obviously, group redundancies on a great scale. What followed was a drastic decrease in the economic status of the majority of the inhabitants. Though I observed this phenomenon and spoke, for example, to the local unemployed, I only photographed the symptoms that could be observed in the industrial, or rather postindustrial, landscape.

**Iwona Kurz: <br />Is it to be understood that these limitations, or the _oversights_ of the project, resulted precisely from the aesthetic inspiration that made you choose a convention of representation, one obviously burdened with cognitive consequences?**

**Wojciech Wilczyk:** <br />I think it is true. The decision to work on black-and-white material, which appeared to me as plain, logical and unquestionable, led, as I said, to the specific limitation of the subject. Colour technique seems to be, or simply is, way more transparent. The monochrome forces the choice of slightly different motives, that can be somehow aestheticised through the use of chiaroscuro, contrast manipulation and the scale of halftones. Postindustrial, concrete ruins are just perfect for monumentalisation, which enables us to see them as “postindustrial sculptures” and overshadows the social issues, which were pretty dramatic in Upper Silesia at the time.

**Iwona Kurz: <br />Unfortunately, I have to agree with this self-assessment. To me, this “Silesian” project is an example of the kind of photographic documentary activity where the surface covers the subject. By surface I mean precisely the adopted aesthetic convention. In contrast to this, I would suggest a notion that belongs to a wide range of archival practices: the *inventory*. In my opinion, it adequately describes your other project, *There’s No Such Thing as an Innocent Eye*. I would define it as a practice based on the assumption that one can carry out a physical inventory and thus display a certain present state of affairs. Surely, it is also a construct, structured by the utopian conviction that a neutral or objective confirmation of being is possible. However, an inventory could be a project allowing – while properly planned and conducted – for the transgression of the various aporias of archive and documentation, or at least of our attitude towards the archive. It is a project reaching (asymptotically, of course) a certain ideal of metonymic notation or description.**

**Whereas, when looking at these “Silesian” pictures I ask myself questions regarding, not the subject and the registered reality, but questions about the impact on the spectator, the emotions these images provoke. These are nice photos, displaying landscapes filled with emotions. The consistently applied convention produces the aforementioned impression of a nostalgia effect. A certain transfiguration of the temporality occurs: it is no longer “the here and now,” but a ruin. Suddenly, the abstract image of a timeless, devastated territory falling into oblivion emerges. Here, the tension between the specific or local and the metaphoric that is immanent to photography, seems to shift towards metaphor.** 

**Wojciech Wilczyk:** <br />I think that it actually sends us back to projects created twenty, thirty, fourty years ago in the monochromatic technique. Speaking of the inventory, I believe that my actions, more or less consciously, were of this character. However, after finishing the project, when the album was published, I realized how important it was to mark such actions, finalized in a compact form, with an authorial touch. The arrangement of the photographs in the album _Silesia in Black and White_ came about as a result of a compromise between me and the editor of the book and I was not fully satisfied with it. It was then that I understood the necessity to fully control my future works, for here, as I think of it now, the entire statement shifted towards the nostalgic metaphor, impairing the “inventorial” character of the project.

**Iwona Kurz: <br />One needs to add that it is not only about the decision regarding colour. It is possible to imagine a project in which the choice of black-and-white would not bear such aesthetic consequences.**

**Wojciech Wilczyk:** <br />Surely, it depends not only on the choice of monochromatic or colour technique, but also on intentions, and the adopted strategy of expression. However, there is no doubt that in this case the decision to use black-and-white material unfavourably limited the thematic field. Frankly speaking, there was a moment when I photographed the ruins of the Huta Królewska coking plant that I removed the filter from the lens – I have always used filters, usually yellow and orange – and noticed, in the light of the sunset, that the walls of a concrete silo for coal, overgrown with lush weeds, actually were completely yellow. It was then that I realized that I was missing something because of the monochrome.

**Iwona Kurz: <br />I also meant that the reception of photography strongly relies on the habits of spectators, on their notion of realism and aestheticisation. Photography often happens to be cognitively fruitful only when it transgresses certain habits, disturbs mundane states, enables us to see something anew. Sometimes it is all about transparency, neutrality, so that the medium and the formal attempts (always present) would not attract attention. One can refer to habits connected with the perception of archival material, e.g. chronicles of World War II. What is of importance here is the clash with the certain non-obviousness of the existing, albeit rare, colour material. The meanings of films and photographic projects that refer to them depend heavily on the decision to the use of either colour or monochrome. This decision carries additional meanings, playing with the habits of spectators who are used to the black-and-white chronicles associated with the past, and who thus tend to treat colour as more contemporary and realistic.**

**I understood that it was this “Silesian” experience that oriented you towards “no-style photography?” I purposefully use this expression, alluding to the discussion on your photographs led in the *Obieg* magazine. One of the objections stated that you are a “photographer in search of his own style.”** 

**Wojciech Wilczyk:** <br />Krzysztof Jurecki, who used this words while reviewing *There’s No Such Thing as an Innocent Eye*, did not mean a historical style, but the style of individual expression. His article features the names of photographers whom he considers to have such individual style. 

Let us look at the images from the *There’s No Such Thing as an Innocent Eye* cycle. They include images of every Polish synagogue, *beit midrash*, and house of prayer that is presently deprived of its religious function. To be quite frank, at the beginning I made the decision to work in the monochromatic technique. I thought that the use of black-and-white material would enable me to underline the character of these buildings, their architectural shape, and allow me to suppress every contemporary element. I quickly realized how flawed this strategy was. While processing the negatives, I confronted the scanned images with what I had in my memory and understood that all these imports, elements of disorder, mess, decay, “stylistic interventions” – all the contemporary context – were of great importance here. I decided to show these buildings in their surroundings instead of avoiding them. 

**Iwona Kurz: <br />I agree that this was of importance for many reasons. What is somehow obvious, directly visible in these photographs, is that the Polish villages were shown in their fullness. One can see the character of these spaces, where old edifices, either ruined or rebuilt, both exist and co-exist. It contributes to the continuity between the chosen subject and its background – the exposure is drawn into the context.**

**Wojciech Wilczyk:** <br />I agree, however, the *Innocent Eye* followed a certain process of reaching the final shape of the project. As I have already mentioned, some basic assumptions were changed. I did not think, for example, of photographing all the buildings. This idea emerged when I was already working and realized the scale of the phenomenon I was dealing with, the diversity of the buildings’ forms, both the original ones and those resulting from reconstruction. I mean the elevations of these objects. I photographed only their exterior, usually deprived of the elements referring to their past religious function.

At first I also planned a more rigorous mode of presentation. I considered, for example, a classical typology, displaying only facades, photographed _en face_ and of similar proportions. The more flexible attitude was forced by the very character of the subject, the variety of the buildings’ forms and locations. An attempt at a visual typology, featuring, for example, certain common characteristics of the chosen motif, would be the wrong attitude or even an unfeasible task. Such frontal and rigorous presentation would weaken the aforementioned context in which these buildings exist. Thus, the attitude towards the presentation of the subject was forced or strongly modified by the very character of the photographed objects.

The aforementioned article by Krzysztof Jurecki included the objection that the pictures were taken in the uneven weather conditions, at various hours and in different seasons. I did this consciously. In order to photograph 307 edifices I had to travel across Poland for two years, traversing tens of thousands of kilometers. Whether I liked it or not, I was to take pictures in varied light conditions. I thought of it as a distinctive mark of this project and a reference to “road photography,” a genre characterized by the conscious weakening of “aestheticizing” strategies.

However, I tried to make my pictures visually attractive, interesting for the potential viewer. Despite the inventorial character of the series (which is a documentation of the cult buildings of Judaism), I cared about the spectator who would watch this abundant material of over 300 images as a book or a slideshow. The aforementioned “strategy of proceedings” is still present in these photos, but it does not come to the foreground.

**Iwona Kurz: <br />To me, what is interesting in these pictures is the seemingly unattractive aspect – the melting of the subject into the background. The things we see “on top,” before reading the caption: all these churches, beauty parlours, offices, shops located in buildings that used to belong to Jewish communities. Here one can see Poland as an aesthetic hybrid and as a palimpsest, though the older layers do not always reveal themselves at the first glimpse of the eye. Many of these buildings do not uncover their “descent.” An entire sequence of shifts occurs. The project’s profile has been immensely changed by the decision to use colour, and by shifting the focus to presenting the object in its proper, local context. What was altered was the defining question: the images cease to say “there was a synagogue here;” they say: “here is the building where the synagogue used to be.” It is a completely different statement to me, differently defining relations between the past and the present, the past owners and present occupiers. It prevents, among other things, the nostalgic effect we mentioned. In contrast, one can recall *Po-Lin*, the documentary by Jolanta Dylewska: the opening sequences of the movie display similar photographs of houses. One could assume that before World War II they were inhabited by Jews. There is a clear suggestion that these doors, windows and frames somehow call to, their former inhabitants, wait for them. Actually, it does not seem to be so. Anyway, the *Innocent Eye* shows rather the life “after” and “despite.”**

**Wojciech Wilczyk:** <br />When it comes to “calling,” I can confirm that these buildings do not do this. However, one can still experience an incredible void and stillness in the vicinity of these buildings, where the Jewish quarters are or used to be. This is in spite of the fact that after the deportations to ghettoes, after the Shoah, the buildings were completely overtaken by new tenants.

It is also connected to my growing maturity, reaching this project. Before I even decided to photograph synagogues, since my earliest childhood, I have felt this void, “a question mark” of sorts that referred to many buildings located in the Dębniki quarter in Cracow, where I was born. This visual signal, received by me since I was a child, was very strong, though I could not interpret it properly for a long time. Later on, when I traveled in Poland (I travel a lot in a car) as a grown man, I was coming across similar quarters in small towns and villages. And I was coming across this “question mark” again. It emerged from behind the facades of derelict buildings and closed market places. When I started the intense work on the *There’s No Such Thing as an Innocent Eye* project, I found these places in the vicinity of the photographed synagogues. The answer that I searched for turned out to be very simple.

A quite valid question, which I had to face while working on the *Innocent Eye*, refers to the aforementioned notion of the inventory. It is about action that aims at the conscious creation of archival resources. A year passed since the project started, I photographed over 100 buildings (I have returned to some of them a few times) and still, I did not have an idea for how to arrange such a collection of images. In order to avoid the accusation of manipulating the material that was to be gathered in the archive (Allan Sekula wrote brilliantly on this subject), I always strived to put my project into its final form, its published form. In the case of the project that we are discussing, the question of the arrangement turned out to be simple, despite their various forms and locations. I had already decided to photograph every synagogue, *beit midrash* and house of prayer located within the present borders of the Polish State. At one stage I understood that the best form for displaying such material would be a lexicon of sorts, presenting the photographs in alphabetical order.

It was because of a conscious reference to inventory-like actions – though, as I always stress, *There’s No Such Thing as an Innocent Eye* is, above all, an artistic project – that I decided to complete each of the photos with a written commentary; a description of the building, its history, architectural form, depending of course on the available source material, which was sometimes very scarce. The same form was chosen for the 700 page book. The picture always appears on the left and is accompanied by the commentary on the right. Because of this, none of the buildings remains anonymous; however – after all the reconstructions – it is hard to distinguish the described architectural style.

**Iwona Kurz: <br />I think that is a very effective strategy. In some sense I consider myself to be its victim. I learned of the project from the press and promotional descriptions, and so, as a matter of fact, through photographs that were especially telling or recognizable. Later, when I took the book in my hand (metaphorically speaking, for the volume is of considerable weight) and started to look through it from the very beginning – A for Augustów – I caught myself pondering what was actually Jewish in this architecture. I have the impression that this project provokes a certain perverse process in which photography serves as a medium of identification. It is analogous to what we, unfortunately, know all too well from Polish history and Polish visual practices – to the identification of what is Jewish and the Jew, to the creation of an image or, rather, a certain stereotype of Jewishness, the construction of its visibility. Some of the buildings bear visible traces of their old style; their architectural distinction is clear, other edifices are not marked by it. I do interpret the display of this fact, a demonstration, as an indirect criticism of the discourse that demands the presence of the stranger, the visual identity of the other.**

**At the same time, this recognition, enabled by the project, also shows an entirely different thing: first, that there was some different architectural reality in Poland, and thus a cultural one; secondly – that it has been somehow absorbed, together with the related past.**

**Wojciech Wilczyk:** <br />Yes, it has been somehow assimilated…

**Iwona Kurz: <br />One can bitterly say that we have assimilated Jewish culture at last – after its end. The importance of these traces for Polish culture also requires consideration. Is it a mere leftover of something deprived of meaning? Does this absorption of the architectural elements mark some form of seizure of the elements of broader culture? Are these mere signs that disturb the maintenance of peace, recall not-entirely-solved affairs from the past? And, in a broader sense, what does it say about contemporary Poland and its more or less convincing aesthetic practices and inclinations? How is our public space constructed, how do we process and absorb the past?**

**The context is provided here – to me, however, it is separate from the meaning of the photographs themselves – by the conversations with inhabitants, who are suspicious of somebody who wants to photograph buildings that used to belong to the Jewish community.**

**Wojciech Wilczyk:** <br />After few months of photographing, after seeing a hundred of such buildings, it was easier for me to distinguish which of them had been rebuilt. The architecture of the synagogues, especially in the case of the orthodox synagogues, was submitted to quite clear and rigid rules. If I had any doubts about the “assimilation process,” or “melting into the landscape,” I would simply ask one of the inhabitants. In Poland everybody knows very well which building used to be a synagogue or used to belong to a Jew before the war. This memory continues, and does not only involve the generation that can remember Polish-Jewish citizens from before the Shoah.

In the beautifully named village of Ryczywół, in Wielkopolska, I photographed the former synagogue, which had been turned into a dwelling house (of the old decorations, only the pilaster strips of the side elevation survived). Suddenly, the window opened at the ground floor of a nearby house. Someone asked me if I was photographing “the house of assembly.” My confirmation was followed by a question: “and how about the nearby German one?” Thus, one can see that the memory of the former proprietor is still alive in Poland and the process of assimilation, being mostly the process of erasing of all the elements proving the sacral function, relates only to the external layer.

The idea to write down and edit the conversations with the inhabitants of the photographed villages (I did not include the one from Ryczywół) came to me unexpectedly during the project. Primarily, I did not plan any interviews. However, during my work I was asked what I was doing, and, more often, “for whom” was I doing it or “at whose order.” Sometimes the conversations were longer. Anti-Semitic resentments and linguistic stereotypes, as if taken from the press of the interwar period, appeared, to my surprise. The situations I experienced were not of a homogenous character. Sometimes I was confronted with verbal aggression, sometimes with a comic course of events. After having few conversations of this sort, I have realized that my ears were witnessing a splendid body of material that could complement the project. I had no idea how many conversations there would be, I neither initiated (the initiative was always on the side of the accidental observers of my actions) nor recorded them. After a little while, I would write them down. Anyway, I suspect that if I had a Dictaphone in my hand, many of these conversations would not have taken place, or would have had a totally different character. I edited this material later, in a form similar to press reportage. For while I do treat the project as an artistic one – as I have already mentioned – this idea occurred to me as appropriate in the context of the entire work.

**Iwona Kurz: <br />These commentaries introduce an additional level to the project. They reveal the ethical attitude of the photographer, who ceases to be a mere subject of the documentation. They also persuade one to interpret both the project and the photographed buildings in a more univocal way – in the context of the so-called Polish-Jewish question.**

**I would like to recall one more aspect linking _The Innocent Eye_ to the notion of the archive. This project is connected with a process in which the artis-photographer has to conduct an archival research of sorts. It is preceded by archival research in the strict meaning: working in the archive and discovering parts of the buildings on paper, before they have been recognized through field work. All this serves a certain lesson of looking, learning how to see. Due to the lack of excessively aestheticizing strategies, the role of the photographer’s task shifts – in a very important manner – from the field of aesthetics to the field of cognition.**

**It is also of some consequence for the spectators, confronted with the necessity of answering more or less inconvenient questions. It must be clear by now that I do not cherish the nostalgic perspective. It is comfortable, positions the onlooker as the self-sentimental subject recalling something with affection, grief or sorrow, even being sorry for oneself. However, when self-pity is over and the “second tear,” of which Kundera writes in *The Unbearable Lightness of Being*, has been shed, there is no more fuss to be made. There were Jews – there are no Jews. There were synagogues – there are other buildings. the *Innocent Eye* is different, for the emotional neutrality of these photos provokes questions referring to both the past and to the shape of present reality. Here, we are confronted with a living reality; with buildings that in most cases are still being used, that have a past of sorts and some sort of present. Should one do anything with it? Is this a mere question of knowledge, of the conscious look?**

**What meanings does the past bring us, including the past of Polish Jewish culture? There are many questions provoked by a project designed in this manner.**

**Wojciech Wilczyk:** <br />I agree. Returning to the subject of style, the style of the personal statement and its symptoms in the visual layer – I think that in the case of the documentary projects, documentary photography, the conscious creation of the archival resources, what is more important is the consequence of the undertaken strategy. What is this strategy? It is a number of decisions referring to the choice of equipment, optics, photosensitive material (or, in the case of digital photography – the characteristics of the matrix), methods of processing of the registered material, but also the way of presenting the subject, the choice of perspective and the construction of the frame, the kind of light and aura. Each project demands a different strategy and its elements are combined in accordance with the undertaken subject.

The risk of adopting a highly individualized style, demanded from me by Krzysztof Jurecki, lies in the acute limitation of the thematic field. Bogdan Konopka, who was listed as a positive example in the aforementioned review, produced (more or less at the same time – he might have started even earlier) a vast photographic project devoted to Jewish cemeteries in Poland, entitled _Grey Memory_. It is no surprise; his series devoted to Paris was entitled _Grey Paris_, and the one on contemporary China – _Grey Empire_. The title has serious semantic potential (no irony intended), however it is in vivid disproportion to the subject and what could be seen in the photos.

Bogdan Konopka has been using the monochrome technique and large-format camera for several decades. He usually takes photos in dispersed light, using the rich scale of halftones, and presents the images solely in the form of a contact sheet. His series feature nostalgic and picturesque images from cemetery areas, where the matzevas are overgrown with ivy, the light penetrates crowns of trees and high, waving grass covers the tombstones, etc. The focus on the aestheticisation of the subject, performed with the use of the monochromatic convention that has been used for years, excluded from the scope of this “grey memory” such cemeteries as the one in Radziłów, where a garbage dump was located, the one in the Bałuty district of Łódź, where there is a street and a housing estate, in Klimontów, where there is a school playground, or the one in Sejny, which is practically a meadow, because there is not a single matzeva.

**Iwona Kurz: <br />*There’s No Such Thing as an Innocent Eye* finds its continuation in another project based on the recognition of memory traces in the contemporary topography. Could you present it before we open the discussion with the audience?**

**Wojciech Wilczyk:** <br />The strategy undertaken during the work on the *Innocent Eye* will be developed in the project, *Other city*, carried out with Elżbieta Janicka. It focuses on contemporary Warsaw. We have decided to vivisect a modern city with a tragic history. The focus of our interest is the city centre, that is, the part that used to be an informal Jewish quarter before World War II. During the occupation a vast part of this area was turned into a ghetto (in the centre of a city with 1,000,000 inhabitants) that was subsequently liquidated, with the deportation of the inhabitants to death camps. After the Ghetto Uprising, which started April 19, 1943, the area was deliberately destroyed – during the fights, and later, the buildings were burnt and blown up.

Our goal is to photograph this area of interest from a bird’s eye view. To register all stages of the postwar urbanization, and to examine how these urbanizing actions influenced the legibility of the city pattern from before 1939. A few months of work on this projects taught us that there many relics of the prewar complex survived, which have consequently fallen prey to the activities of developers. Our photos are taken exclusively from an elevated viewpoint, from staircase windows or flats located on the 10th–11th floor. The large-format camera that we use operates with 4x5 inch plates and is adapted to move the optical axis, that is to perform so-called shifting, enabling one to “dive” into the city. We decided to use analogue technique and large-format negatives, which means that after being scanned and adequately processed in the graphic program, we will be able to make copies or prints of the size 160×120 cm, perfectly sharp and with all details reproduced.

Working on the *Other City*, we are making an attempt to photograph, not only the area of a former ghetto and the earlier Jewish quarter, but also traffic routes (or the traces of the ones long gone), and places important for the tragic history of the district, such as the locations of gates and walls, or the culverts connecting the small and big ghetto (such as the footbridge on Chłodna Street).

Our photos regularly appear on the blog [nowe-miasto.blogspot.com](https://nowe-miasto.blogspot.com/). The project will end with the publication of an album consisting of – according to initial ideas – approximately 60 images. Each will have a caption containing information about what is visible in the photo, but also about what we won’t be able to see, what can merely be imagined basing on the symptoms present in the frame. We do not yet know the composition of the planned book. The idea will probably evolve with the growth of registered material.

**Iwona Kurz: <br />It is the time for questions from the audience. Please join our discussion.**

**Paweł Szypulski: <br />I would like to return to the project *There’s No Such Thing as an Innocent Eye*, and to a decision that appears to me to be one of the most important. That is, the buildings chosen for the project are located in the present-day territory of Poland, not in the confines of pre-war Poland. I have the impression that it is a very bold, radical choice, pointed against sentimental attitudes.**

**Wojciech Wilczyk:** <br />I decided to photograph all such buildings located within the present confines of the Polish State, for after 1945 they were – how to say it euphemistically – treated in various ways by the citizens. Photographs of the very interesting, but often devastated buildings located in contemporary Belarus or Ukraine would provoke comments that “Russians always behave like this.” I was interested in how we behaved, what our attitude towards the memory of our neighbours who were killed during World War II was.

**Iwona Kurz: <br />If I understand the question correctly, it seems to also refer to the fact that this project focuses on the present, without turning to the mythical “Eastern Borderlands,” without some symbolic annexing of former territories, but calling for the settlement of what we do have today.**

**Wojciech Wilczyk:** <br />Yes, there is also the question of the “Eastern Borderlands.” A short digression here: a year ago an album was published, *Eastern Borderlands Photographed by Henryk Poddębski*. Poddębski is a an author who has, unfairly, been somewhat forgotten. The album, according to the title, presents the narrative of the lost territories in a touristic-nostalgic-sightseeing form. However, in terms of Polish prewar photography, Henryk Poddębski was an absolutely brilliant, modern documentary author, free of pictorial mannerisms. His photos of the eastern areas of prewar Poland – let us leave aside the colonial term “borderlands” – are modern and, taking photographic representation into account, evoke associations with the work of the best American authors influenced by Roy Stryker. Excellent photos that feature not only landscapes, but also representatives of the minorities living in these areas. They will not be found in the works of the pictorialists who form the circle of Jan Bułhak.

**John Tagg: <br />There is an increasingly wider debate in the United States, which concerns photographing of Detroit. This city became bait, a necessary goal for everyone who wants to register industrialization. The debate is heated not only among professional critics, but also among bloggers. Its participants have a very hostile attitude towards the way in which the city is represented. It resembles reactions to other photographic depictions of cities, for example, Robert Polidori’s work on New Orleans after Hurricane Katrina. The debate led by the blogger-amateurs who describe the invasion on Detroit conceived the term ruin porn, quite an amazing concept that keeps engaging me a lot. I am struck by your attempt not to come into this category or attitude (even if I do not know exactly what it means). On the one hand, it is the question of the rhetoric of the image; on the other, however, of establishing an emotional relation with the spectator, attracting him with an appealing image. The effort to distance yourself from such emotional bonds with spectators make you different from the FSA and similar documentary traditions, locating you closer to Walker Evans.**

**Wojciech Wilczyk:** <br />I am familiar with maybe three photographic projects devoted to Detroit, and with two or so albums entitled *The Ruins of Detroit*. I think that they are really good books. Looking at them, I did not have the impression of “visual pornography” or “ruin porn.” I do not know whose works specifically were discussed by the bloggers. At the moment I recall a very interesting series by Jeff Brouws, entitled *Discarded Landscape*, also featuring demolished and abandoned dwelling spaces in the Detroit area. In the case of this author I had the impression that he criticizes economic model in which, when the production becomes unprofitable and factories close down, what follows is the degradation of the entire urban environment. There is no such process in Upper Silesia, a region of a similar status, however I need to admit that some of the postindustrial districts in the region are starting to resemble *favelas*.

And a word of commentary on the ruins, for I have also photographed them, but in monochrome. I think that these ruined plants, closed factories left to be devastated, constitute the modern motif of _vanitas_ – vividly present in the European fine arts – expressing instability, death and passing. It is good that the photos you mentioned are visually attractive. They need to be: the spectator should want to see them. All strategies that help attract the public are absolutely recommended.

And thank you for Walker Evans.

**Sven Spieker: <br />I greatly enjoyed the way you present your work. However, I had the impression that there has been a tension between the soberness of the pictures themselves, of your archive, and a certain form of _catharsis_ that you seem to describe when commenting on the photos. One can get the impression that the construction of this archive was linked to some form of redemption. The feelings these pictures evoke in me do not necessarily agree with what you say about them – it is true, some of the buildings are in bad shape, but many of them seem to be normal, just like the people who live there.**

**Wojciech Wilczyk:** <br />When it comes to the issue of “redemption,” in this case we can speak only about guilt, this is how I see it. There is no and cannot be any *catharsis*. Anyway, this project was not created in order to lead anyone to such a state.

However, the question of dwelling in such buildings is far more complicated. One can observe the process of religious recession in Europe. It results in the sales of churches, their transformation into flats or sports halls (I have seen an Anglican church in Liverpool that was turned into a mountain climbing training hall). The problem is that in Poland we come across the tragic history of Polish Jews, who made up 10% of the country’s population before 1939. Attitudes towards these buildings are the evidence of our memory of our killed neighbours. These objects should be treated with empathy for the sake of what happened to Polish-Jewish citizens. There is often no information on the reconstructed buildings telling people that it used to be a synagogue. Meanwhile, one can often see memorials referring to local events, or to the 20th anniversary of the People’s Republic of Poland.

**Wolfgang Ernst: <br />I would like, in a sense, see a third participant in this discussion – not a man, but a camera. If it could talk. Why? To its lenses there is no difference between Detroit and Upper Silesia. Talbott, while discovering his photographic technique, was happy that the camera freed him – the painter – from the subjectivity of the eye. How do you deal, as a photographer, with this radical dichotomy between the human eye, which is never innocent, and the pure innocence of the camera lenses?**

**Wojciech Wilczyk:** <br />You allude here, very observantly and accurately, to the title of the project. I borrowed it from another title, the press review of a big group Polish documentary photography exhibition, _The New Documentalists_, organized in the Zamek Ujazdowki Centre of Contemporary Art in 2006. It was the first broad presentation of the Polish “new documentary” – and, in addition, an exhibition at the art institution. Andrzej Deptuła, author of the review, objected that the participants of the exhibition did not take on social or historical issues, and were basically interested in careers in the professional gallery abroad, that is, in the production of collectors’ objects for sale. I took it as a form of challenge, and the very expression “there is no innocent eye” also refers to some concepts of realism in 18th century painting, questioning the objective character of realistic representations. I think that everyone who decides to express his views in the form of documentary photography, to prepare documentary photographic projects, everyone who does this consciously, faces this dilemma from the very beginning. The lenses themselves might be innocent – as you said – and they register the Ruhr Coalfield or Upper Silesia in the same way, but the way of organizing the registered material, the choice of subject, and one’s motives result from certain preferences of the author, from visual education. It is, after all, the outcome of the obsessive actions that play a very important role in art. But I persist in the belief that the camera itself – which, according to Willem Flusser, includes every possible mode of picturing every subject in its “programme” – is an instrument, _per analogiam_ with the musical instrument – it is not that innocent… Here recurs the question of the strategy of proceedings, which also touches upon the subject of the tools that we use.

**Katarzyna Bojarska: <br />I would like to ask Iwona Kurz a slightly perverse question. The last debate from the “Archive Looking Awry” section was entitled “Archives of Disputable Histories.” We have seen two presentations somehow focusing on archiving or documenting certain specific conflicts. Don’t you think that what Wojtek Wilczyk does is – though he calls it documentary photography – is something similar, the consistent process of documenting and archiving a very concrete conflict. In Silesia it is the socio-economic antagonism and its notation on the landscape. *Life after Life*, unrecalled in this discussion, is, on the other hand, a story of transformation, deeply marked by conflicts and different forms of violence. The *Innocent Eye* reveals something that could be called memory wars.**

**Iwona Kurz: <br />I agree only partially. In some sense it is somehow obvious, what you referred to – reality is filled with tensions and conflicts, what is more, black strongly contrasts with white. Photography can be almost always described through pairs of oppositions, that is some form of conflict. The projects you recalled feature conflict somehow at the forefront. Maybe that is why I interpreted them, practically on the spot, as a lesson about the reading of photographs above all, about the extraordinary critical lesson of visual culture. What is important – they all refer to existing photos and archives. In that sense, they differ from Wojtek Wilczyk’s work, for he in fact creates archives. I hope this discussion also managed to show, with the use of a critical apparatus, how a certain idea of archiving is born and evolves. We have cautiously agreed that the Silesian project did not fully represent certain social tensions, although I would be easy to account for the social conflict during interpretation. However, in the case of the _Innocent Eye_, there is a vivid conflict of two aesthetics, characteristic of the Polish landscape. Yet I am not sure whether we live in a state of war when it comes to Polish-Jewish memory. I would like to underline this point by commenting on these photos and the rural reality that they reveal. I observe a vast discrepancy between the temperature of the discussions on certain books and the unknown warmth of the actual role of this problem plays in the everyday life of Poles – for example those, who are using the buildings photographed in the project. Can we really speak of conflict here? Or is it rather a hybrid reality?**

**Wojciech Wilczyk:** <br />If I was to describe the intentions of the project *There’s No Such Thing as an Innocent Eye*, I would point to the fact that I wanted it to be read on various levels of meaning. Luckily, the reception is usually like this. It is a project which touches upon a very specific story – the tragic fate of the Polish Jews. Not only, however: it also encompasses a big chunk of Polish postwar history, as well as shows a whole spectrum of the attitudes that transformed the sacral buildings of Judaism in Poland. Finally, on the most universal level, it is a project that describes the results of racism and of ethnic cleansing policies everywhere on Earth.
