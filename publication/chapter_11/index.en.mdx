> The decision to work on black-and-white material, which appeared to me as plain, logical and unquestionable, led, as I said, to the specific limitation of the subject. Colour technique seems to be, or simply is, way more transparent. The monochrome forces the choice of slightly different motives, that can be somehow aestheticised through the use of chiaroscuro, contrast manipulation and the scale of halftones. Postindustrial, concrete ruins are just perfect for monumentalisation, which enables us to see them as “postindustrial sculptures” and overshadows the social issues, which were pretty dramatic in Upper Silesia at the time.

> I think that these ruined plants, closed factories left to be devastated, constitute the modern motif of vanitas – vividly present in the European fine arts – expressing instability, death and passing. It is good that the photos you mentioned are visually attractive. They need to be: the spectator should want to see them. All strategies that help attract the public are absolutely recommended.

> To be quite frank, at the beginning I made the decision to work in the monochromatic technique. I thought that the use of black-and-white material would enable me to underline the character of these buildings, their architectural shape, and allow me to suppress every contemporary element. I quickly realized how flawed this strategy was. While processing the negatives, I confronted the scanned images with what I had in my memory and understood that all these imports, elements of disorder, mess, decay, “stylistic interventions” – all the contemporary context – were of great importance here. I decided to show these buildings in their surroundings instead of avoiding them.

> At first I also planned a more rigorous mode of presentation. I considered, for example, a classical typology, displaying only facades, photographed en face and of similar proportions. The more flexible attitude was forced by the very character of the subject, the variety of the buildings’ forms and locations. An attempt at a visual typology, featuring, for example, certain common characteristics of the chosen motif, would be the wrong attitude or even an unfeasible task.

> Working on the _Other City_, we are making an attempt to photograph, not only the area of a former ghetto and the earlier Jewish quarter, but also traffic routes (or the traces of the ones long gone), and places important for the tragic history of the district, such as the locations of gates and walls, or the culverts connecting the small and big ghetto (such as the footbridge on Chłodna Street).

> We have decided to vivisect a modern city with a tragic history. The focus of our interest is the city centre, that is, the part that used to be an informal Jewish quarter before World War II. During the occupation a vast part of this area was turned into a ghetto (in the centre of a city with 1,000,000 inhabitants) that was subsequently liquidated, with the deportation of the inhabitants to death camps. After the Ghetto Uprising, which started April 19, 1943, the area was deliberately destroyed – during the fights, and later, the buildings were burnt and blown up.
