# The Archive from Askance

<Author link="/chapter_22">Lucia Nimcová, Ewa Klekot</Author>

<Abstract>The text below is a dialogue with Ewa Klekot, montaged by the artist and based on a public discussion between Ewa Klekot and Roman Babjak that took place in Warsaw on the conference The Archive as Project. The artist also used fragments of the stories told by Humenné’s inhabitants that she included in the text Pod červenou čiarou / Under The Red Line. The organisers would like to thank Roman Babjak, without the help of whom this chapter would not have been possible.</Abstract>

> Chekhov often expressed his thought not in speeches – wrote Stanislavski – but in pauses or between the lines or in replies consisting of a single word […] the characters often feel and think things not expressed in the lines they speak.:{{^1}}

**Ewa Klekot: <br />What would you think about cross-titling your projects? To me, _Unofficial_ is much more what Marián Kusík was doing because he documented the unofficial, private sphere of people’s life; while _Leftovers_ would be in turn the images of Juraj Kammer: the place they are being kept now in the Regional Centre for Culture in Humenné, as you told me, somewhere in a cupboard next to the loo; and also the message your work on them transmits seems to be very much about the “leftovers” of the old, Soviet system still there, in 21st century Slovakia…**

**Lucia Nimcová:** <br />Both projects are *Unofficial* and *Leftovers* at the same time. In *Unofficial* I was working with material officially paid by state, but also archiving unofficial images, critically documenting the opposite they were commissioned for. When I was finishing *Unofficial* I did not know I that would be continuing with the other archival project, and of course I did not know that it will be called *Leftovers*. In general, I am interested in any kind of leftovers.

**Ewa Klekot: <br />I find a meaningful difference in your approach to both of the photographers’ personalities. The way we get to know Kusík is more personal and intimate. You give him the voice, with his own words and his life story, while we do not get the chance to know Kammer: why?**

**Lucia Nimcová:** <br />Kammer was an official photographer, obliged to do a certain job that he was paid for. He was supposed to be professional, let’s say without an opinion – neutrally documenting for the future what was happening in the official life of the district. By making selections from his archive I had a chance to visually illustrate not only the era, but also his personality. I do not think he was showing his opinion openly, but out of twenty years of taking images of the same places and same people over and over again, I had enough space to select hidden sides of his personality, through the images themselves. I like the idea, that there is much bigger voice behind it, pushing people to do what they did, while being photographed by Kammer. They would not do the same just for him. They did it for the system and sometimes they are caught doing it wrongly, or they are not looking heroic for many reasons.

With Kusík it is different. He was coming to people’s homes, making portraits of their small children. I think it is necessary to know the stranger personally, before you decide to do so. I wanted people to look at his images through his life experience and knowing why he was doing what he was doing in his free time for free. At the same time, his pictures are very intimate, it is almost like all of the photographed kids became his own kids for a little while, so it makes sense to know a bit about his personal life too.

**Ewa Klekot: <br />When you find an archive, the first thing you do is to select some images that seem more appealing, or in your case also more suitable to your projects. What was the clue to your selection? What did you find attractive in the first place? How did they suggest your interpretation?**

**Lucia Nimcová:** <br />Projects do not have the same form… each of them is individual, even if there is some continuation. I do not have a concept that I use for all the material, rather each new piece of material asks for a different interpretation. And a book is usually different from an installation in an exhibition… in an installation you can develop the time and context of each exhibition. A book is usually a statement in the moment, when you are on the upper wave of your mind? Your mood changes after finishing the work. You become a different person. I would have not been able to make the Unofficial project today. I am not that angry anymore.

**Ewa Klekot: <br />But was there any clue to your selection?**

**Lucia Nimcová:** <br />For the selection in the archive I was using different concepts. One was more rational, later more intuitive. One was working with the topic of the representation of women, another was showing bad compositions, formal mistakes and so on. I was curious, what will stand out from different selections and why? The result in the book is some kind of essence. It is very interesting for me to know what I consider important even after watching it every day over a period of two years. I can rationally explain the selection of every image, but I did not use one strong concept structure for all of them. I was trying to change my relationship to the past, because I wanted to change my future. Nowadays I am looking forward to the future while being aware of the things I could not change at all, but it does not mean that I am not aware of them.

**Ewa Klekot: <br />I feel that you are using photography for detecting similarities of form, but also for creating those similarities. To me it’s not only finding a form – understood as a gesture, or bodily behaviour, or position – but also creating and questioning it. Have you considered what could be beneath this form? Because I do not really believe that this form is empty…**

> “Zekon, Chemlon, Chemes, the hospital & Mekom made around 700 people redundant in a space of half a year. Most of them were managers in high positions. That’s quite a lot for a town with 35 thousand inhabitants, bearing in mind that half of them went abroad anyway.
>
> “Friday he met up with a business partner in Paris and on Monday a redundancy notice was awaiting him on his desk. An engineer highly specialised in chemical fibres. He had orders booked for half a year in advance. 58 years old. He’s finished.”
>
> A masseur at the swimming pool says to me: “You know what? Nowadays even those who have never been afraid are afraid.”
>
> “Hey, you know what?” my mate stated, “I have a feeling that people are terribly afraid in this town of Humenné. I feel it’s even worse than it was in communism. The other day I was talking to a man on the street. First he looked around and then whispered something quite normal.”
>
> “My colleagues don’t greet me on the street because they were afraid that the boss might see them. They would become disfavoured. I am the only one who stood up to him and am now being punished for it,” says another woman.
>
> Anonymous informing is at large. People mostly phone in.
>
> “Morale and law in complete breakdown. Harass them. Morass.”:{{^2}}

**Ewa Klekot: <br />After the transformation one can often have the feeling – as you seem to have in _Unofficial_ – that nothing has changed, as the form seems to stay the same, but actually there are changes that are going on underneath, this is at least is the experience I have had in Poland.**

**Lucia Nimcová:** <br />At Vihorlat library the discussions with the members of Green Stone have been cancelled. According to the new manager, discussions about consumerism, protection of the forests, economic crisis, animal abuse and democracy are not for the category of people they are aiming for. The Nights with Andersen for children are to end too. Nineteen employees of the library are supposed to focus on pensioners instead. The staff are signing in on the attendance book. 7 o’clock is the red line. Whoever comes late will receive a warning, and occasionally one may be dismissed. Depends on how often he or she opens his mouth. They don’t need people that inconvenience them. Why spoil the last few years leading up to pension? Somehow they have to last those 8–9 years…

> “Once, back in the communist days I drew all the lines in the attendance book in red, just for fun. The director laughed at it. Today I wouldn’t dare draw those red lines.”
>
> When a discussion is being organised at the library (approximately 5 times a year), refreshments are strictly prohibited. No tea, nor coffee. Not even if people bring their own, because the kettle would use electricity and the cups would have to be washed. No exceptions. Don’t send anyone to my office, no discussion.:{{^3}}

**Ewa Klekot: <br />What is relationship of the photographed with their archival aliases? Did you ask people involved in the project?**

**Lucia Nimcová:** <br />In the past, while working on the project *Instant Women 2002–2006*, I believed that I could show reality. Even following people for years, I could not show all aspects of their lives. There was always something missing. It was more that I was trying to speak with their own voices through my images, I had a feeling I was not succeeding. In the end I came up with the best compromise possible, understandable to the wider public in the Eastern Europe. Anyway, what was clear to people from the East was double coded in the West. I realized, that the best way is simply to have my own view on what is going on. In the *Unofficial* project I made my own vision and worked with people more as objects, not subjects. And if subjects, than from my own perspective. Therefore, it is my own reality.

**Ewa Klekot: <br />When you watch the video, it is true, they are enjoying themselves. You do not feel that there is a strong power relation going on, but there are some power relations. First, because your protagonists are supposed to perform your script – it’s you that is putting them into their roles; and what is more, what you are trying to do, in my opinion, is to find out and sort of reveal hidden bodily disciplines they are following. Discipline is obviously an expression of power relations too. Did you investigate these power relations while working on the _Unofficial_ project?**

**Lucia Nimcová:** <br />Many of the images I made, I would say 90%, are documentations from the official events in the town, a continuation of the past, they would just change the titles of the events. Usually you would see the same people there with some of the new ones. I went there, as many other photographers from local newspapers did, and documented what I felt was a continuation of the past. Of course there were many new things happening at the same time, but I was curious about those from the past, being alive. A few images are staged, they came from my imagination. Video *Exercise* is my own concept. I asked people older than 50 to exercise for me, without telling them what to exercise and without saying for how long. I was curious what would happen.

**Ewa Klekot: <br />In a totalitarian system what is meaningful is the private, what is hollow is the public sphere; so the Everyman gets more meaning than the Hero. This is a kind of revenge of the individual on the totalitarian regime.**

**What I find in your projects is a clear, critical comment on the public sphere, but there is no such a strong comment on “the Kusík side of reality”, the private. We know that Kusík quit making pictures – why didn’t you feel compelled to comment on his photographs with your own pictures? To show the present of the private sphere, as you have done with that of the public?**

**Lucia Nimcová:** <br />In the book *Leftovers*, you can read under each picture a little story, usually as one sentence. The sentence is not explanation of the image, it is an individual observation, which I call “written photography.” That is, I decided to use written images, instead of photographing them. I liked that idea, because anybody who would read those texts could imagine their own image. That means at the same time, that the book is open, not finished for the viewer.

**Ewa Klekot: <br />Do you think that the people involved in your projects share the vision of their reality that you are trying to transmit?**

**Lucia Nimcová:** <br />This is a very difficult question for me to answer. Depends which kind of people you have in mind? If you think about people from my hometown Humenné, I have to say that they gave me the town prize for promoting Humenné abroad. The official ceremony was like the best scenario for my *Unofficial* project. I was very disappointed, that my work was definitely redundant at that moment.

**Ewa Klekot: <br />The system is inscribed in our bodies, but is it inscribed in our minds?**

**Lucia Nimcová:** <br />People of my age used to say that we need other generations to come and than all will change. I have to say that many officials of my age are even worse than the generation before them. Of course, it is not so bad everywhere. We do not have so many stable rules, as in the western societies, so if somebody really wants to change things, it is usually very hard, but not impossible.
