# Living Archive: The Performative Potential of a Document

<Author>Nataša Petrešin-Bachelez</Author>

## A Case Study: the contextual part of the exhibition *The Promises of the Past*

A historic accompanying document of an artwork provides augmented visual access to the representation of that artwork and, on some occasions, is the only trace that is left to constitute that artwork as such. The “need to document”:{{^1}} and the desire to see and be persuaded by the reality the document is revealing, has become the object of enormous attention in recent theories and practices of exhibition making and museum studies. No longer arising only from the artists’ engagement with archival methods of classification and presentation,:{{^2}} whose outcome is often a “politics of the truth,”:{{^3}} contextualisation as a certain pedagogical turn or “pedagogical aesthetics,”:{{^4}} which an insight into an archive provides, can be observed in many progressive art institutions and museums.

In the following text, I will look more closely at the second complementary part, the so-called contextual part of the exhibition _Promises of the Past_ that I curated, in order to evoke the idea of a living archive – in this case, a living archive of the emerging discourse about former-Eastern Europe. By assessing the notion of a performative document, I will discuss the reactivation and presentation of various types of documents, as well as the reactivation of a semi-forgotten local (Parisian and French) memory that they bear witness to.

One of the most recent thematic exhibitions that placed questions related to the history of conceptual and contemporary art in former-Eastern Europe at the heart of its research and display was *The Promises of the Past 1950–2010, A Discontinuous History of Art in the Former Eastern Europe* at the Centre Pompidou (spring 2010). The exhibition was consciously divided into two main parts, or two complementary exhibition *parcours*. The first part, co-curated by (Christine Macel|Macel, Christine):{{#people}} and (Joanna Mytkowska|Mytkowska, Joanna):{{#people}} and displayed within a zigzag structure created by the Polish artist (Monika Sosnowska|Sosnowska, Monika):{{#people}}, dealt with the particularities of conceptual art from former-Eastern Europe and the different types of relations, such as reactivation, re-enactment, quotation—between neo-avantgarde practices and contemporary artistic positions from both the former-East and the former-West of Europe. Through seven chapters—Beyond the Modernist Utopias, Fantasies of the Totality, Anti-art, Private and Public Space, Female-Feminist, Micropolitical Gestures and Institutional Critique, Utopia Revisited—the *parcours* established itself not as as a linear narrative but as a display within and around spatial “pockets” created by Sosnowska’s zigzag structure.:{{^5}}

The presentation of “documentary evidence” and “archival objects”:{{^6}} (artworks, sources, letters, articles and film or video documentation of performances) formed the contextual part of the exhibition that occurred within an architectural structure conceived by the Slovene artist (Tobias Putrih|Putrih, Tobias):{{#people}}. The objective of the contextual part was to reveal how theoretical and art historical discourses about former-Eastern Europe are developing. Artworks by the group (Irwin|Irwin):{{#people}} and artist (Deimantas Narkevičius|Narkevičius, Deimantas):{{#people}}, archives of the Paris-based Gallery 1-36 and Galerie des Locataires (Tenants’ Gallery), archives of (Pierre Restany|Restany, Pierre):{{#people}} and the Paris Biennial, as well as the film and video documentation of performances of the artists on view in the living archive of _The Promises of the Past_, were chapters in the historical analysis of the exchanges between France and former-Eastern Europe, especially in the 1960s and 1970s. The central curatorial question brought forward within the contextual part of the exhibition was the (im)possibility of transmitting an ephemeral experience through the reproduced form of a document. The notion of living archive seemed thus most appropriate to tackle this (im)possibility, especially a crucial inspiration was an ongoing series of documentary exhibitions _Living Archive_ at the Van Abbe Museum, Eindhoven, which bases its presentations on the museum archives in dialogue with the museum’s collection. Those exhibitions are focused on “the future of the past,” which is

<br />

> _vitally important for the museum’s identity and self-consciousness […] Cultural and historical contexts are reconsidered, the little-known history of a work of art is revealed, and the artist’s considerations are scrutinized._:{{^7}}

A changing display and a series of video programmes, discoursive events within the exhibition space, and the attempt to represent what a performative document could be, have thus contributed to the living archive of _Promises of the Past_.

One of the first exhibitions to consciously address the document and its relation to performance in former Eastern Europe was _Body and the East_ (1998), curated by (Zdenka Badovinac|Badovinac, Zdenka):{{#people}} at the Moderna galerija in Ljubljana. Badovinac curated a survey on body art in Eastern Europe, presenting an important counter-universalist point about the difference between actions done in the West and in the East of Europe by observing that similar gestures have different readings in different geopolitical contexts. A later exhibition by Badovinac, _Interrupted Histories_ (2006), focused furthermore on archiving as an artistic practice and a mode of self-historicisation. In his two programmatic lectures in Paris in 2009 (organised by the seminar _Something You Should Know_, EHESS, and by the Centre Pompidou, Paris), (Manuel Borja-Villel|Borja-Villel, Manuel):{{#people}}, the director of Museo Nacional Centro de Arte Reina Sofia in Madrid, talked about the increasing role of archives in group or solo exhibitions.:{{^8}} As Manuel Borja-Villel wrote,

> how are experiences, which are at once unrepeatable and infinite, collected? How does one render visible and transmit a work of a textual sort that has more to do with the archive and the document than anything else?:{{^9}}

The French critic (Catherine Millet|Millet, Catherine):{{#people}} qualified the exhibition _Promises of the Past_ as “essentially documentary”:{{^10}} and within her short commentary this denomination turned out to be pejorative. Thus, the question of a document’s status vis-à-vis a work of art—regarding its representation, actuality and its potential to perform the inaccessible past—is the key issue.

## Typology of Documents

A variety of documents was presented in the living archive within the exhibition. The established typology that follows here is linked to questions about the document and its performativity as proposed by (Philip Auslander|Auslander, Philip):{{#people}}, the American theoretist of performance.

Let's first look at the concept of mediatized performance by (Auslander|Auslander, Philip):{{#people}}, which will bring us closer to the performative document. As Auslander has demonstrated in his writings about “liveness,” the ontology of liveness is not produced simply by the presence of a performer. Some performances which contain live presence are highly “mediatized” (to use Auslander’s term) and therefore do not have an ontological live quality (and may not be experienced as “live” in some other understandings of the term), and some works which are entirely technical in their production, and should therefore have none of the conventional descriptors of the live, nevertheless do have the ontology and effect of liveness. One way of interpreting this anomaly is to consider liveness not as a property inherent in certain events and phenomena, definable only by reference to the objective properties of that event, but rather that liveness is a conceptual metaphor that we use to understand a range of different phenomena. The concept of liveness clearly does not have the concrete structure of easily apprehensible form, and is therefore only capable of being understood via metaphor, in terms of more concrete concepts, which require kinaesthetic and embodied experience to provide structure and scope for elaboration.

In his seminal text, _On the Performativity of Performance Documentation_,:{{^11}} (Auslander|Auslander, Philip):{{#people}} references his colleague, (Amelia Jones|Jones, Amelia):{{#people}}, the American theoretist of performance and body art, who in her essay _Presence in Absentia_ explores the relationship between performance and document. Reinstating photography’s position as an access point to the reality of performance, Jones declares that she is

> respectful of the specificity of knowledges gained from participating in a live performance situation […] I will argue here that this specificity should not be privileged over the specificity of knowledges that develop in relation to the documentary traces of such an event. While the live situation may enable the phenomenological relations of flesh-to-flesh engagement, the documentary exchange (viewer/reader ↔︎ document) is equally intersubjective.:{{^12}}

Building on this argument, (Auslander|Auslander, Philip):{{#people}} classifies any performance documentation into two categories: documentary and theatrical. The latter is particularly interesting for our discussion here, as Auslander includes in it projects where the performance is totally staged with the sole purpose of being recorded, the original event bearing no preceding meaningful existence whatsoever: “The space of a document, be it visual or audiovisual, becomes the only space in which the performance takes place.”:{{^13}} The series UFO by (Julius Koller|Koller, Julius):{{#people}} that extended itself throughout many years since the late 1960s until the artist’s death can be seen as belonging to this notion, as can (Sanja Iveković’s|Iveković, Sanja):{{#people}} seminal work _Triangle_ or (Mladen Stilinović’s|Stilinović, Mladen):{{#people}} _Artist at Work_. Not only the captured reality or situation, but also its production features in the work itself. When confronted with the theatricality, the document’s authenticity and its ability to reflect reality is discredited. The consequence is that the spectator does not see the document as the communication of information but as the staging of information.

In the conclusion to the above-mentioned text, (Auslander|Auslander, Philip):{{#people}} states that

> the crucial relationship is not the one between the document and the performance but the one between the document and its audience. Perhaps the authenticity of the performance document resides in its relationship to its beholder rather than an ostensibly originary event; perhaps its authority is rather phenomenological than ontological… It may well be that our sense of the presence, power and authenticity of documented performances derives not from treating the document as an indexical access point to a past event but from perceiving the document itself as a performance… for which we are the present audience.:{{^14}}

(Auslander|Auslander, Philip):{{#people}} continues along similar lines in his most recent research, drawing again from his old principal source, (Walter Benjamin’s|Benjamin, Walter):{{#people}} concept of reactivation (from *The Work of Art in the Age of Mechanical Reproduction*, 1936), that a reproduction reactivates the original. In another article entitled *Toward a Hermeneutics of Performance Art Documentation*,:{{^15}} Auslander quotes Benjamin in order to make the connection that enables thinking about the relationship between mediatized performances and their audiences

> Technical reproduction can put the copy of the original into situations which would be out of reach for the original itself. Above all, it enables the original to meet the beholder halfway, be it in the form of a photograph or phonograph record… In permitting the reproduction to meet the beholder or listener in his own particular situation, the technique of reproduction reactivates the object reproduced.:{{^16}}

For (Auslander|Auslander, Philip):{{#people}}, the adjective “halfway” particularly highlights the entropy of the transmission that is at work during the reactivation process.

In his recent essay _Reactivation: Performance, Mediatization and the Present Moment:{{^17}}_, (Auslander|Auslander, Philip):{{#people}} further develops his theoretical approach to performance documentation, focusing on the phenomenological relation of the public to the performance document, and less on the ontological relation of the document to the original performance. In his approach, Auslander observes that a spectator’s primary action regarding performance art is not the witnessing of live events but the imaginative reconstitution of performances from images, whether held in memory or available through documentation. He draws on the hermeneutics of the German philosopher (Hans-Georg Gadamer|Gadamer, Hans-Georg):{{#people}} (_Truth and Method_, 1960) who argues that understanding something does not consist of revealing an objective truth inherent in it, waiting to be discovered. Rather, understanding proves to be something that emerges through dialogue, in our case the dialogue between the performance document and its public. Following Gadamer, Auslander claims that the public’s imaginative reconstitution of a performance from its documentation is not a process in which they retrieve information about something that took place in the past, but is itself a performance in the present in which we take part.:{{^18}}

Furthermore, the notion of performativity can be attributed to the document itself. By assessing this concept through (Judith Butler’s|Butler, Judith):{{#people}} _Excitable Speech: The Politics of the Performative_ (1997):{{^19}}, where performativity is defined as a study of the discourse used in identity formation and law-making, or (J. L. Austin’s|Austin, John Langshaw):{{#people}} _How to Do Things with Words_ (1962):{{^20}}, where stating objects is considered in some circumstances similar to constituting those objects, and linguistic expression does not simply take place but carries out an action at the same time, we can see that the concept of the performative document describes the ways in which words are used to describe and define reality, or perform events. In the curatorial decisions for the contextual part of the exhibition _Promises of the Past_ it was interesting to note that if we consider the past through the aspect of the performativity of language, we can detect how, while observing it through images or other material, our words and interpretations assist in the understanding of the past.

The exhibition _Universal Archive_ (2008-09) at MACBA in Barcelona presented the history of the photographic document and its genealogy. The exhibition _Vojin Bakić_ (2008) by the curatorial collective WHW in Zagreb went a step further: while the part of the exhibition that contained the artist’s sculptural models was inaccessible to the public most of the time and only seen from the outside, the part with the documents and other archival material was open all the time.
