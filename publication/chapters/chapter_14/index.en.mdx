# The Shattered Face of History

<Author link="/chapter_22">Zuzana Meisnerová-Wismerová</Author>

<Abstract>We would like to thank Karolina Lewandowska from the Fundacja Archeologia Fotografii/Archeology of Photography Foundation for taking the initiative for the Conference Archive as Project as well as Krzysztof Pijarski, Piotr Słodkowski and the whole team for the perfect organization and generous hospitality, and for the interesting days we spent in Warsaw.</Abstract>

> Only recently, (Jan Langhans|Langhans, Jan):{{#people}} joined the ranks of now well-known Czech photographers like (Josef Sudek|Sudek, Josef):{{#people}}, (František Drtikol|Drtikol, František):{{#people}}, and (Jaromír Funke|Funke, Jaromír):{{#people}}. He had once, long ago, been famous for his _Gallery of Personalities_ (_Galerie osobností_), which he had assembled over many years, beginning in the late nineteenth century. That was a period when Czech society was gaining self-confidence, and it is no coincidence that it was also when Slavín, the cemetery of great Czechs, was being built at Vyšehrad in Prague. More than fifty years later, however, shortly after the Communist takeover, orders were given to remove to a dump the 1.5 million negatives of the Langhans archive, which had been the source of photographs for the _Gallery of Personalities_. Some brave, far-sighted person, in an unusual way (possibly the only way) hid some of the negatives in a cupboard next to the coal cellar of the studio, thus managing to save 9,000 glass plates. Undoubtedly he or she – we shall probably never find out who it was – did so in the hope that the negatives would see the light of day some day in the future. This unique discovery gave the Czech story of disrupted continuity another dimension. It became big news in September 1998, capturing the imagination of many Czechs, and not just those interested in photography. It was a symbol; it represented the hope that in a free society it would be possible to resume the good traditions that the totalitarian regime had cut short.:{{^1}}

The fate of my great-grandfather, (Jan Langhans|Langhans, Jan):{{#people}} (1851–1928), is an example of the fate of the Czechs: the fruits of his labours, cultivated over generations, were destroyed when the Communists came to power in 1948.

Trained as a chemist, (Jan Langhans|Langhans, Jan):{{#people}} became enchanted with photography. He established a studio, Ateliér Langhans, in Prague in 1880, and worked his way to becoming one of the best-known portrait photographers in Bohemia. In the third generation after him, the studio was nationalized and then forgotten. The state-owned enterprise that took over the photography studio drew on the success of Jan Langhans’ studio, but the name of its founder seemed to have been forgotten in the dustbin of history. Only a few experts knew Langhans’ importance for photography.

(Langhans|Langhans, Jan):{{#people}} fully adapted the building in Vodičkova street (No. 37) to the photographer’s craft. In the 1890s photographs were taken on the courtyard directly adjacent to the Franciscan Garden. An ingenious system of blinds regulated daylight. With time, and the discovery of new techniques, the possibilities of taking photographs expanded. New little buildings appeared on the courtyard, together with laboratories, a drying-room, and a retouching-room. In the course of almost seventy years, from 1880 to 1948, hundreds of thousands of people passed through Ateliér Langhans. In 1949 my father, (Viktor Meisner|Meisner, Viktor):{{#people}}, the last owner of the studio, had to leave his business in Vodičkova.

The nationalizing of the studio sent Ateliér Langhans into the family’s past. The archive of negatives, which for decades had been carefully built up, was destroyed. My father was left with only two cardboard boxes containing several photographs and some souvenirs. One of them is a folder which bears the title _Ateliér Langhans – Galerie význačných osobností_ (_Langhans Studio – A Gallery of Outstanding Personalities_), and comprises a list of important persons in the arts, culture, and politics of the Bohemian Lands, who once had had their portraits made in the studio. The list had been compiled in the late 1930s, when – evidently out of fear of the Nazis – the negatives with portraits of important persons were removed and deposited in a special place. In the early 1950s, when (my father|Meisner, Viktor):{{#people}} no longer had access to the studio, the whole archive, about 1.5 million glass plates, was taken to a dump in a village near Prague. All the glass negatives were smashed to pieces. The memory of generations, the faces of the proponents of spiritual values, suddenly became a pile of glass shards. All that remained was ten densely written pages with more than a thousand names.

When the building had been returned to the family in the beginning of the 90s, it was to be renovated. Before this could be done, its walls required thorough inspection. On this occasion workers discovered an old wooden cabinet in a shed by the courtyard. The cabinet was sealed with a small padlock. When opened, it revealed, beneath sixty years’ worth of grease and grime from the nearby coal furnace, several hundred boxes of glass negatives with portraits of notable personalities from Bohemia and the rest of Europe. The boxes, mostly about 18×24 cm, are marked with a system of Roman and Arabic numerals and labelled with the names of the persons whose negatives they contain.

It is this precise system of description above all that graphically illustrates the size of the find. It allows one to catch a glimpse of the extent of the tragedy recalled by this discovery. The Roman numerals indicate professional groups, the Arabic the number of boxes of the individual groups. What has remained preserved is the incomplete groups of photographs of actors and singers, writers, artists and musicians, scholars and scientists, aristocrats, politicians and industrialists, and foreigners in Bohemia. The amount of missing boxes, which can be deduced, makes apparent the irreplaceable loss of countless portraits, and thus makes the find a testimony to cultural barbarity.

Obviously it would be wonderful if the archive of outstanding personalities was complete. But what is immensely valuable is that at least its torso was found. On the thousands of faces one sees the past with its external signs such as the clothing fashions, expressions, and postures of those being portrayed, and also the method of photography. The _Gallery of Personalities_, however, tells us something else: the photographs demonstrate what an essential crossroads of European culture Prague was in those days. In the discovered archive the portraits of Czechs, whose activity often went well beyond the borders of this country, mix with those of foreigners who lived, worked, or were just visiting here. In a natural way then, the collection demonstrates the importance of the Bohemian Lands for Europe, and becomes an eloquent testimony to the past. For countries with violently interrupted histories it is precisely this sort of knowledge of one’s past that opens up the way to the future. The old building in the centre of Prague, whose walls are permeated with a strong smell of developer, has revealed its secret. And it rehabilitated the photographer (Jan Langhans|Langhans, Jan):{{#people}}.

The reconstruction of the house was achieved in 2002 under the Architect (Ladislav Lábus|Lábus, Ladislav):{{#people}}. We decided to exclude part of the property from commercial use and to dedicate it to photography. This is where the non-commercial Langhans Gallery and the Langhans Archive are located today. House Langhans is a multifunctional building with apartments, stores, offices – and the gallery.

We as the owners of Langhans House established the Langhans Foundation. Today the Archive is owned by this Foundation. The Langhans Foundation is bankrolled by yearly contributions from the proceeds of the real estate and is partially supported by the Ministry of Culture.

The story of the rediscovered cultural treasure in the dusty basement of the run-down building sounds – maybe not only to us – like a fairy tale. And our own story, both that of our family and that of the Czech as seen on (Jan Langhans’|Langhans, Jan):{{#people}} glass plates, provides an inspiring historical background for the contemporary exhibitions.

The Gallery is focused mainly on contemporary photography. The Gallery was opened in May of 2003. Since then, we have presented 40 exhibitions.

As for the archive, the 9,000 found glass plates are back at their original place, where they are kept in an air-conditioned room. We store and restore the glass plates to the best of our knowledge and ability. The restoration work is done “in house” – we therefore set up a special workplace, following expert recommendations from (Herman Maes|Maes, Herman):{{#people}} from Fotomuseum Rotterdam. Periodically, a highly qualified conservationist from Neuchatel, Switzerland closely monitors the work on site. Glass shards are being assembled and loose emulsions fixed. The negatives are cleaned by expert hands and prepared for a final digitalisation.

We willingly loan the portraits for publications and exhibitions. A first book appeared in 2005. In addition, we have shown new prints of glass negatives in several exhibitions. Today the content of the archive is fully accessible to everybody on [www.langhansarchiv.cz](http://www.langhansarchiv.cz/), where it is researchable by names or by categories.

> The fate of the Langhans Studio is a general reminder that one of the worst things to have happened in this country was the systematic uprooting of people from their native soil, from places where they grew up and to which they were related, the destruction of “historical memory.” With its authentic testimony, photography can help in the renewal of memory, getting to know oneself, and finding continuity. The story of the rediscovered archive of (Jan Langhans|Langhans, Jan):{{#people}} is also evidence of that.:{{^2}}

Consciousness of responsibility for this cultural treasure led to the establishment of the Langhans Foundation. The legacy of my great-grandfather, the photographer (Jan Langhans|Langhans, Jan):{{#people}}, and of his inspiring personality thus remains alive.

There is no doubt that this continuity of place and origin is unique: today, the name Langhans stands for the interaction between old and new.
