# Index / Finger: Medium and Materiality in the Archives

<Author link="/chapter_22">Nina Lager Vestberg</Author>

## Introduction

Early on in (David Lodge’s|Lodge, David):{{#people}} novel, _Nice Work_ (1988), there is a description of one of the protagonists, the feminist literary critic Dr Robyn Penrose, having sex with her partner, Charles, who is also a literary scholar. The reader is told that Charles’s “techniques of foreplay” are so meticulous as to cause his lover, on occasion, to nod off, only to “wake with a guilty start to find him still crouched studiously over her body, fingering it like a box of index cards.”:{{^1}} This image of the academic who makes love much in the same way he conducts research is funny, of course, because it suggests that scholars of literature are prone to confound bodies with texts, pleasure with work, and lived experience with library study. On a more subtle level it throws up further connotations, such as the physical aspects of archival research itself (the “fingering” of actual index cards), and the archival object as a sensitive, even sensuous being. Finally, it produces an image of the body as an archive in its own right, both in the sense that it records and accumulates traces of lived experience, and, by virtue of being a place of restricted access, the material of which one must be granted permission to peruse. The aim of this paper is to explore the relationship between body and archive, not as an analogy, but as a variation on the relationship between medium and materiality. How does medium matter in the archive? I wish to explore this question by way of two works of fiction, which to my mind provide powerful mediations of the meaningful matter of archives. The first is (A.S. Byatt’s|Byatt, Antonia Susan):{{#people}} novel _Possession: A Romance_ of 1990,:{{^2}} which was subsequently made into a Hollywood movie in 2002, and the second is (Stephen Poliakoff’s|Poliakoff, Stephen):{{#people}} television drama, _Shooting the Past_, which was first screened on BBC in 1999 (and which was simultaneously published as a screenplay). I choose to explore these questions through readings of a novel and a tv drama mainly because works of fiction tend to distil experience in ways that are more immediately graspable than detailed field reports or statistics. This is helpful when trying to address complex issues in the space of a relatively short text. Before I begin my analysis, however, a brief note on two of the keywords in my title.

The index, it needs hardly be said, denotes a system for navigating an archival collection, such as a library catalogue. It frequently also refers to the physical artefacts in which this system is instantiated, such as a filing cabinet or a codex volume. In the (Peircean|Peirce, Charles S.):{{#people}} semiotic system, of course, the index is also the name of a type of sign that has a causal link to its referent: like a pointing finger, it indicates the object to which it refers. Fingers are not just for indicating, however, they are also for touching. And in the archive a great deal of time is spent touching, handling, yes, even fingering material objects – including the index catalogue itself, whether it is instantiated on paper cards or pages, or more commonly these days, the computer keyboard from which the digitised index is accessed. What is more, the fingers of researchers and archivists leave their marks on the archival material itself. As the writer (Nicholson Baker|Baker, Nicholson):{{#people}} noted in an article on the destruction of card catalogues in US libraries during the 1990s, the repeated fingering of index cards by readers over the years has built up dirt bands on the edges of the most frequently-consulted cards in any given catalogue. Accordingly, “[b]efore you have read or touched a single card,” you will have obtained important information about a collection simply by registering which parts of its catalogue are more soiled than others.:{{^3}} This insight came back to me recently when I conducted research on a collection of photographic glass slides that had been used in the teaching of nuclear physics in the 1940s and 1950s. Although no catalogue or index to the collection has been preserved, it was at least possible to deduce something about the frequency with which different slides had been in use by comparing the degrees to which their surfaces were covered in fingerprints and greasy smudges.:{{^4}} Fingers, then, leave their imprints on the file. In the process they add new layers of meaning to the documentation contained within it, be they in the form of dirt bands, dog ears, smudges, or other material indices of repeated handling.

> The book was thick and black and covered with dust. Its boards were bowed and creaking; it had been maltreated in its own time. Its spine was missing, or rather protruded from amongst the leaves like a bulky marker. It was bandaged about and about with dirty white tape, tied in a neat bow. The librarian handed it to Roland Michell, who was sitting waiting for it in the Reading Room of the London Library. It had been exhumed from Locked Safe no. 5 where it usually stood between Pranks of Priapus and The Grecian Way of Love. It was ten in the morning, one day in September 1986.:{{^5}}

These are the opening lines of (A.S. Byatt’s|Byatt, Antonia Susan):{{#people}} novel *Possession: A Romance*. They introduce the chief protagonist, literary scholar Roland Michell, as he is about to examine an old book which has belonged to the (fictional) Victorian poet Randolph Henry Ash, a writer on whom he is an expert. The book is a copy of (Giambattista Vico’s|Vico, Giambattista):{{#people}} *The New Science* (1744) and in it Roland expects to find textual evidence of Ash’s reading, which he subsequently intends to trace back to the poet’s writings. From the very first sentence, however, the novel clearly signals that it is not Vico’s text as such that will be of consequence to the story, rather, it is this specific, material *copy* of Vico.:{{^6}} The excerpt above relays three kinds of salient information. First, a description of the archival object (the book) as fragile, physical thing: “maltreated”, “bandaged” and “covered with dust”. Second, an exact location for the retrieval of the object: “Locked Safe no. 5” at the London Library. And third, the time and place where this consultation took place: “one day in September 1986”, in the Reading Room of the aforementioned London Library. Description, date and location are of course the elementary features of any inventory or catalogue entry, and so what Byatt provides in these opening sentences is, among other things, a means by which the reader may immediately enter into the archival mindset of the novel.:{{^7}} Indeed, this particular volume turns out to be an archive in its own right. Having had its tapes undone by Roland, “[t]he book sprang apart, like a box, disgorging leaf after leaf of faded paper, blue, cream, grey, covering with rusty writing, the brown scratches of a steel nib.”:{{^8}} The bits of paper had been protruding from between the pages, so that their blackened edges “coincided precisely with the present positions, edge of page and edge of stain.”:{{^9}} Attending to “these expressive dirt bands”:{{^10}} in a manner that would have met with (Nicholson Baker’s|Baker, Nicholson):{{#people}} approval, Roland concludes that the volume and its contents must have lain untouched since the late 1850s. Tucked away among the pages and other notes, he finds a draft letter from Ash to an as-yet unidentified woman. He is moved to purloin the sheets of paper on which the letter is written in order to try and find out to whom it might have been addressed, and if it was ever sent. Roland soon discovers that the addressee must have been another (fictional) Victorian writer, Christabel LaMotte, and soon he is put in touch with one of “two people in the world who know all that is known about Christabel LaMotte”, fellow academic Dr Maud Bailey.:{{^11}} Together, Roland and Maud set out to discover what happened between Ash and LaMotte, using their skills and networks as literary scholars and archival researchers. They end up uncovering a love story that has remained unknown for more than a century, and eventually also fall in love with each other.

_Possession_ is a complex and composite text, which in addition to the overarching narrative of Maud and Roland also contains a story-within-the-story about the Victorian lovers, as well as poems, children’s stories, letters and excerpts from diaries and scholarly essays. All these texts-within-the-text are pastiched by (Byatt|Byatt, Antonia Susan):{{#people}} in the language and form appropriate to the different genres and periods to which each of them is supposed to belong. On account of this multi-layered structure, _Possession_ has often been seen as an exponent of postmodernism in fiction. Yet for all that it displays typically postmodernist traits of meta-consciousness and fictional self-awareness, the novel is to my mind more usefully classified, in (Suzanne Keen’s|Keen, Suzanne):{{#people}} terms, as a “romance of the archive”. That is to say, it makes use of archival research as “the kernel plot action” in a narrative that is structured, along the lines of a classic romance, as a quest.:{{^12}} Racing against time, as well as against competing colleagues from both England and the United States, Roland and Maud embark on a quest for the truth about a relationship between two people who have been dead for a hundred years. In the process, they experience personal and professional hardships, but also intellectual, cultural and physical pleasures. And in the end, they discover new things, not only about the past, but equally about themselves and about their own, present lives.

Not only does the content of archives turn out to have significant bearing on the lives of the novel’s protagonists, but the archival documents themselves appear capable of transcending their inanimate objecthood and reaching into the realm of the living. For instance, Roland is initially compelled to steal the draft letters because he finds it “suddenly quite impossible to put these *living words* back into page 300 of (Vico|Vico, Giambattista):{{#people}} and return them to Safe 5.”:{{^13}} A little later on, when he has become acquainted with Maud and decided to tell her how he came by the letters, he tries to justify his theft by explaining his sense of them as being “alive.”:{{^14}} This notion is discredited by Maud, who has as yet only seen the letters in photocopied form. A few pages later, however, she gets to see the hand-drafted originals, and concedes: “I see […]. They’re alive.”:{{^15}} In one sense, this presents a romanticised view of primary sources as auratic objects; although less easily legible than the “cleaner and clearer” photocopies, “the faded coppery-grey script of the originals”:{{^16}} appears somehow animated to an extent that neither Roland nor Maud are fully able to articulate. In the final pages of the novel, moreover, the repeated characterisation of the draft letters as living objects will acquire its proper significance, as it is revealed that Maud is, in fact, the descendant of both Ash and LaMotte, and so the living heir to, and rightful proprietor of, those “living words.”

Yet before this denouement, the genre conventions of the romantic quest demand that Roland and Maud be put to the test of their abilities and imaginations. And it is precisely a combination of ability, knowledge and imagination that leads them to discover the hoard of correspondence that constitutes the chief archival find of the story. A cache of love letters by Ash and LaMotte is found thanks to Maud’s intimate knowledge of LaMotte’s poetry, which primes her memory to recall precisely the relevant verse that contains the clue to the hiding place – a secret compartment inside a doll’s bed – when she and Roland happen to be allowed inside the decrepit old country house where LaMotte had spent her last years. In fact, few of the truly valuable documents in _Possession_ are found neatly filed and indexed in boxes or filing cabinets, although these central tools of the analogue archive are much consulted by its characters in the course of the narrative. The draft letter that triggers the quest is found (and stolen from) inside a book, the love letters have been kept in the aforementioned doll’s bed, while the final clues – which include both a letter, a photograph and a lock of hair – are retrieved, morbidly, from the grave of Randolph Henry Ash. Together, these unorthodoxically-archived objects reveal that Maud herself is the great-great-great-great granddaughter of both LaMotte and Ash, being descended from their illegitimate daughter. Gazing together with Roland at a photograph of her great-great-great grandmother, which has been exhumed from Ash’s grave, Maud says, “She looks like Christabel”, at which Roland replies:

>“She looks like you.”
>
> He added, “She looks like Randolph Ash, too. The width of the brow. The width of the mouth. The end of the eyebrows, there.”
>
>“So I look like Randolph Henry Ash.”
>
>Roland touched her face. “I would never have seen it. But yes. The same things. Here, at the corner of the eyebrow. There, at the edge of the mouth. Now I have seen it, I shall always see it.”:{{^17}}

Maud’s body, then, constitutes an archive of its own; a genetic repository of physical attributes handed down, as it were, from Ash and LaMotte. And at the very end of the novel Roland gains privileged access even to this archive, as he finally takes “possession” of Maud’s body. Yet this takes place only after the “infinite gentle delays and delicate diversions and variations of indirect assault”:{{^18}} that reveal him, too, as a scholarly lover; as studious in bed as he has proved himself in the archive.

## II

I now want to turn to another work of fiction in which the contents of the archive seemingly “come alive” and reveal their intimate relationship to living human beings. (Stephen Poliakoff’s|Poliakoff, Stephen):{{#people}} play for television, *Shooting the Past* (1999), tells the story of The Fallon Picture Library and Collection, located in a beautiful house on the outskirts of London, which faces closure after it has been bought by a businessman from the US. The businessman, Anderson ((Liam Cunningham|Cunningham, Liam):{{#people}}), has only acquired the collection because it came as a job lot together with the large and impressive building that houses it. When he realises that the managers and employees of the collection have failed to sell off its assets in preparation for the re-purposing of the building as a business school, he is both shocked and angry, threatening to destroy the entire collection. The employees must therefore try to save the collection somehow, ideally by coming up with a compelling reason for Anderson to want to hang on to all of the photographs, not just a few famous and valuable ones. Pitted against Anderson in the fight over the collection’s fate are, chiefly, the library manager, Marilyn ((Lindsay Duncan|Duncan, Lindsay):{{#people}}), and her deputy, Oswald ((Timothy Spall|Spall, Timothy):{{#people}}). Oswald is very much the anti-hero, a crabby and dishevelled figure, who is in fact partly to blame for the predicament in which he and his colleagues find themselves, and whose chief tactic is to try and scare the new owner off by acting like a delusional madman, all the while secretly mining the collection for material that might produce an argument against its dispersal or destruction. Marilyn, on the other hand, is (as her name suggests) a rather more glamorous figure, and her immediate strategy in the struggle is to mobilise the seductive powers of the archive, and to some extent those of herself.:{{^19}}

The librarians’ first attempt at persuading Anderson to keep the collection is simply to overwhelm their new owner with the wealth and range of images it contains. When this fails, they try to move him more directly by presenting a story-in-photographs, compiled from across the collection, which details the fate of Lily, a young Jewish girl growing up in Berlin in the 1930s. Lily’s story emblematises the horror of the Holocaust and the role of photographs in preserving the collective memory of its victims and survivors, as well as its enablers and perpetrators. The story is presented in pictures ranging from amateur snaps, via Nazi documentation, to contemporary street photographs, as Marilyn explains to Anderson how Oswald has managed to construct it on the basis of an extraordinary gift for remembering faces and making visual connections between photographs, as well as an intimate knowledge of the library’s holdings. Although Anderson is moved by this “twentieth-century tale, caught like that”:{{^20}} he refuses to recognise it as a valid argument for keeping the entire collection intact. In the end, the rescue mission only succeeds when they are able to establish a direct, one might even say physical, link between Anderson himself and the contents of the collection. With some unwitting help from Anderson himself, Oswald and Marilyn reconstruct the extraordinary story of his maternal grandmother, as it, too, happens to be documented in photographs scattered throughout the collection. The entire story has been assembled on the basis of one single photograph: a picture of Anderson’s mother which he carries in his wallet and which he at one point is persuaded to show Oswald. Without going into the details of the narrative, suffice to say that Oswald sees a family resemblance in the mother’s portrait to a face he already “knows” from the files: a woman named Hettie, whose adventurous life in the early 1900s is amply documented in the Fallon Library’s holdings of documentary, art and news images. For most of the sequence where he is being told the story of Hettie, Anderson remains sceptical of its validity and especially of the purported link to his own ancestor. Yet as he is presented with more and more photographs of her, his fascination builds, manifesting itself as an increasingly evident appetite for the pictures of his grandmother as a young woman. This is conveyed by the film camera through close-ups of his face, as well as of his hands as he repeatedly touches and strokes the surface of the photographic prints. It is amplified through the soundtrack, which carefully renders the sensual rustle of paper as he leafs through them. Poring over some particularly artistic photographs of Hettie, and admitting that he finds them “weird… sensual,”:{{^21}} Anderson seems almost aroused by the combined visual and haptic pleasures of looking through the pictures of his grandmother. In this respect, he comes to embody one of the sub-themes of this audiovisual production, which is the film medium’s oedipal attraction to its own ancestor, photography.:{{^22}}

Yet it is the final photograph in the story that carries the greatest emotional impact for Anderson. It is a photograph of Hettie as an elderly woman in which he also recognises himself as a child, sitting next to her on his mother’s lap. We remember how, at the end of the novel *Possession*, Roland finds the features of Ash and LaMotte “archived” in the portrait photograph of Maud’s great-great-great grandmother, and the same features preserved in the living archive of Maud’s own face. In *Shooting the Past*, Oswald has performed a visual tracing in the opposite direction, from the “archived” features of Anderson’s mother in the photograph to the very similar features of a face he already knew from pictures in the collection. In the photograph of Anderson together with his mother and grandmother the link is confirmed, as the photograph reaches out from the inanimate anonymity of the archive and points, by virtue of its indexical character, to him as its living referent in the world. Just as when Maud gazes at the portrait of her Victorian ancestor towards the end of *Possession*, Anderson at the end of *Shooting the Past* finds himself as a direct descendant of the archive.

## III

I now come to the question of how these two works, _Possession_ and _Shooting the Past_, may throw light on the media and materialities of archives. First and foremost, they are of course both mediations of archives, admittedly invented ones.:{{^23}} What is more, both the novel and the television drama are in themselves archives of sorts. _Possession_ is, among other things, an invented archive of texts: the codex volume incorporates poems, essays, fairytales, diaries and letters, to name but the most frequently-occurring genres in which the story unfolds. This meta-archival structure has furthermore acquired additional layers over the years that have passed since its initial publication. Reading the book two decades on, one is struck by how completely the story is circumscribed by the precise technological configurations of its day. For instance, to the near-contemporary reader of 1990, the information that the opening scene takes place “one day in September 1986” may have been a perfectly innocuous detail, but within less than a decade it would have become a crucial marker of the novel’s periodicity. True enough, (Byatt’s|Byatt, Antonia Susan):{{#people}} tale of literary pursuit across the centuries could possibly have been set one or two decades earlier, in the late 1960s or early 1970s. Yet within ten years of its publication, the discoveries and adventures of the novel’s protagonists could not have taken place, or could not have taken place in the same way. By the late 1990s, all the central modes of communication upon which the plausibility of the plot relies had become outdated: email had superseded letter-writing, digital image files had replaced the micro fiche, computer cataloguing had made index cards redundant and, not least, mobile phones had all but chased the humble phone booth off the London streets. Virtually all the narrative turning points in _Possession_ happen in, or due to, the pockets of time that in a pre-digital age tended to buffer the moments of sending or leaving messages and receiving or responding to them. What is more, the literary mystery that the protagonists resolve in the course of the plot is itself uncovered thanks to the technical peculiarities of an even earlier culture of communication: the pre-telegraphic era of the 1860s. When virtually all messaging was conducted by letters in ink on paper, the people composing those messages were prone to leaving accidental archival evidence in the form of drafts. And it is precisely one such draft, discovered by Roland between the pages of Ash’s copy of (Vico|Vico, Giambattista):{{#people}} in the London Library, that sparks off the archival quest that forms the central plot of the novel. In his oft-cited book _Archive Fever: A Freudian Impression_, (Jacques Derrida|Derrida, Jacques):{{#people}} writes of the correspondence that makes up a significant part of the archives of psychoanalysis: “a handwritten letter takes so many days to arrive in another European city, and nothing is ever independent of this delay. Everything remains on its scale,”:{{^24}} In the same way, every aspect of the plot in _Possession_ remains on the scale of the precise systems of communication, transmission and archiving that were in place in the mid-1980s. In this respect, the book has also become an archive of scholarly, epistolary and even social practices in the pre-digital era.

The dependency of the plot of _Possession_ on its historical technological present becomes almost painfully clear when viewing the film adaptation of the novel, which was made more than ten years later, in 2002. Choosing to set the action in the near-present of the film shoot (various details of the mise-en-scène suggests the year 2000), the director (Neil LaBute|LaBute, Neil):{{#people}} evidently had a hard time reconciling the “analogue” plot with the technological realities of the movie’s own “digital” diegetic moment. The film just about gets away with neither Roland nor Maud owning a mobile phone in 2000 (they are after all dusty academics, many of whom did lag behind in the acquisition of such luxuries), but the characters’ reliance on the fax machine over email for international communication, to name just one example, would have jarred with most contemporary viewers even at the time of the film’s release. Yet such discrepancies are necessary in order for the plot to make any sense whatsoever.:{{^25}}

As for _Shooting the Past_, both the sequences that tell stories-within-the-story are produced by highly complex layerings of archival material and archival modes. On the surface, there is of course simply a selection of old photographs, but as any observant spectator will realise, the photographs are not “real” old photographs, they are new photographs produced either from old ones or to look like old ones. For all that _Shooting the Past_ is a play about (among other things) the truth residing in photographic prints on paper, the digital imaging application Photoshop was heavily deployed in the (re)creation of these apparently analogue documents. The figures of Lily and of Hettie were “played” by models, whose images were in some cases photoshopped into old news photographs, while in other cases – such as the family portraits of Lily or the saucy, “surrealistic” images of Hettie – the photographs were shot especially to be used as stills in the drama, and then artificially aged to look like vintage prints. In this way they are comparable to (Byatt’s|Byatt, Antonia Susan):{{#people}} pastiches of Victorian poems and letters. Yet in addition to the people, places and events recorded in these “diegetic” documents, another archival layer occurs at the level of the film itself, as the moving camera records the still photographs. Through its moving audiovisuality, _Shooting the Past_ is not only able to reproduce photographs in a way that allows spectators to “read” the content of the images themselves. Just as significantly, it is able to produce interpretations of that content while simultaneously conveying the haptic qualities of the paper substrate. In particular, I would say that the use of movement and sound in _Shooting the Past_ draws attention to the tactile surface and audible materiality of vintage paper prints. In this way the televisual play succeeds in making the photographic documents it contains into something more than the sum of content, substrate and interpretation: as a dynamic archive of photography it produces a surplus of potential meaning and opens up a space for spectators to take their own pleasure in the sensual, and multisensory, properties of the medium.

Although the filmmakers’ choice to relocate the _Possession_ story in time, from 1986 to 2000, puts a terrible strain on the plausibility of the plot, what this bad adaptation demonstrates rather well (although I’m sure it’s not intentional) is the unsuitability of the moving image as a format in which to mediate texts. In a film, where these texts must either be spoken/heard as dialogue or shown/seen as visual artefacts, the medium of text risks depletion: the content of the textual documents must necessarily be shortened, if not entirely elided, and their quiddity as texts is reduced to either mere interpretation (spoken words) or mere substrate (faded paper). The hermeneutic pleasures of reading disappear and, along with them, the pleasure, indeed, the point, of the whole work. This is in sharp contrast to _Shooting the Past_, in which the (re)mediating medium of television proves eminently suited to convey the peculiarities of photography, which that medium is itself unable to reproduce, and where the meeting of the two media produce an abundance of potential meaning. I would say that the same goes for the novel _Possession_, which in its material form as a bound codex invites a gradual entry into the complex textual play of genre and pastiche that, together with the richness of artefactual description, allows the reader to envisage scenes, objects and images which will prove impossible to reproduce “outside” the text.

I have elsewhere discussed *Shooting the Past* as an evocative representation of the photographic archive as a physical, haptic space, viewing it as a compelling representation of what I call “the archive from within.”:{{^26}} By this I mean that it paints a convincing picture of the work that goes on in photographic archives (although this is not to say it is a wholly realistic one). In particular, several scenes in *Shooting the Past* illustrate the spatial character of memory as it is deployed by photographic librarians in the retrieval of images from the analogue archive. This practice of mentally “mapping” the archive is one of several skills that are being eroded, if not entirely lost, as archives are gradually digitised and thus subjected to the logic of the search engine rather than the associative capabilities of the human memory. Although the prospect of digitisation does not feature explicitly in *Shooting the Past* (filmed in the winter of 1997–98, it just preceded the launch of industry-changing websites like those of Corbis and Getty Images), at more than one point it juxtaposes the attributes of modern/digital technology with the skills and abilities of people in ways that clearly side with human creativity over machine logic.

## IV

Insofar as I read both _Possession_ and _Shooting the Past_ as mediations of archives, there are three points I should like to highlight in conclusion to this essay. First of all, both the novel and the television play dramatise the function of the archive as a medium by which we access the past and, equally importantly, as a medium by which the past may gain access to us. Each work establishes a direct connection between “dead” archival documents and living human beings by virtue of the indexical character of the photographic medium, which in both works is taken as a given. It is due to old photographs that both Maud in _Possession_ and Anderson in _Shooting the Past_ are furnished with new information about their own ancestry – or provenance, as an archivist might term it. Second, the identification of this provenance is in turn dependent on the intermediary function of the archivists and researchers who have (in the case of the graverobbing that precedes the denoument of _Possession,_ quite literally) unearthed it. This work of searching, finding and interpreting is another level of mediation in and of the archive, which is in fact closely tied to the material manifestations of its contents. As we have seen, the ability to “read” not only a text or an image, but equally the clues provided by its physical appearance, requires a working knowledge of the material support or substrate upon which it is inscribed, whether this be a glass slide, a photographic print or a handwritten letter.

The final aspect of the relationship between medium and archive, and perhaps the most urgent one, is what we might call the remediation of archives. This is most obviously exemplified in the drive to digitisation which over the past decade has affected (or perhaps in some cases afflicted) virtually all archives of a certain size and scope. The works I have discussed here do not explicitly thematise digitisation, yet in several ways they anticipate a number of digitally-related dilemmas. In *Shooting the Past*, for instance, Anderson wishes to get rid of the picture archive’s contents because he needs the space it occupies for his business school. Although throwing out analogue holdings for such radical re-use has rarely been proposed in real life, (Baker|Baker, Nicholson):{{#people}} has shown:{{^27}} that the “saving” of (three-dimensional) space has been a constant mantra in remediating archive projects, from microfilming in the 1970s to digital imaging in the 2000s.:{{^28}} The literary scholars of *Possession*, meanwhile, anticipate the ambivalence often experienced in encounters with ever-more efficient reproduction technologies. While the photocopier and microfiche are enlisted as solutions to the problem of sharing access to the contents of valuable documents within a global academic community, little doubt is left in the readers’ minds that the original manuscripts retain an intransmissible surplus value of potential meaning. Yet it is perhaps the remediation of the novel itself as a Hollywood film that most clearly illustrates the problems of transposing one archival medium into another. I have already commented on how the medium of film is unsuited to mediating text, or more precisely, the experience of reading texts. This is primarily because the moving, audiovisual character of film works against the slow, silent activity of reading. It remains to be seen how digitisation of analogue texts and images affects our encounters with them. Much, no doubt, depends on the design of user interfaces, for instance the extent to which these will attempt simulation of the “analogue” experience, such as imitating pages to be turned or prints to be leafed through. So long as a medium is defined as “new,” it will be used in “old” ways, as (Régis Debray|Debray, Régis):{{#people}} reminds us.:{{^29}} This implies that the only digital archive that will ever be wholly consultable *as such* is one that contains only items that were conceived and produced in a digital medium.

The question of how medium matters in the archive may simply come down to a question of how it matters in experience. Regardless of the formats in which its holdings are instantiated, the chances are that there will be bodies navigating the files using the tips of their fingers, whether they be shuffling index cards, tapping keyboards, stroking touchscreens, leafing through pages or, shall we say, fingering prints.

{{^6}}:This is not to say that the choice of *The New Science* is insignificant: both Ivana Djordjevic and Lynn K. Wells have argued that is of some consequence to interpretations of the novel that the artefact which sets the plot in motion is a copy of the work in which Vico elaborated his theory of history. Indeed, Wells sees this book as a sort of “master code” to Byatt’s novel. See: Ivana Djordjevic, “In the Footsteps of Giambattista Vico: Patterns of Signification in A.S. Byatt’s *Possession*”, *Anglia* 115, no. 1 (1997): 44–83, and Lynn Wells, “Corso, Ricorso: Historical Repetition and Cultural Reflection in A.S.

{{^7}}:As behoves a novel about the hermeneutic, archival quest of a bunch of literary scholars, *Possession* has itself become a favourite object of study for academics. I will not engage with the vast corpus of critical literature on this work here, as I am primarily using the novel to illustrate my own argument about archives, rather than attempting a new reading of it as such.

{{^19}}:There is some suggestion that the combination of Marilyn and the picture library has been a potent one before: in a short flashback sequence Oswald asks if she has been “carrying on with another visiting academic,” teasing her about a “Norwegian walrus expert” with whom she previously appears to have been getting intimate amongst the print boxes and filing cabinets; Stephen Poliakoff, *Shooting the Past – A Screenplay* (London: Methuen, 1998), 102.

{{^22}}:In the DVD commentary to this play, Poliakoff professes a fascination for what “happens” when a film camera looks at a photograph, a fascination that has clearly provided the very premise for his screenplay. If space allowed it would have been tempting to elaborate on this phenomenon with reference to the representation of the photographic medium in other films, ranging from Michelangelo Antonioni’s _Blow-up_ (1966) to Woody Allen’s _Vicky Cristina Barcelona_ (2008).
