# The Fortepan Open Archive

<Author>Miklós Tamási</Author>

Although a typographer by profession, I have worked with old photographs for more than 20 years. The Open Society Archives at Central European University, my current employer, houses one of the most significant collections of documents on the Cold War and an extensive archive of the Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty (RFE/RL). The latter contains several thousand photographs, but the OSA’s most extensive photographic resource is an archive of 20,000 photographs from a Hungarian periodical called _Magyar Rendőr_ (_Hungarian Policeman_). However, it is not these “official” collections, connected to my professional life, that I would like to address here. Work on them follows the strict traditional methods of archival processing: snapshot by snapshot, series by series, preparing thumbnails and professional descriptions.

Rather, I would like to use this occasion to present an unofficial, private initiative of mine that does not follow professional formal principles: the Fortepan Archive. I will speak about the formation and origin of its photo collection, how it became an on-line archive, and the structure of the website and enterprise.

Every inhabitant of Budapest is allocated one day per year to put the things they no longer need in the street, where they will be collected by street cleaners. In practice, this means that from spring to autumn, week after week, different parts of the city are covered by garbage heaps. Furniture of no use, worn shoes, outgrown clothes, and of course a lot of garbage. When I was a secondary school student, my friend (Ákos Szepessy|Szepessy, Ákos):{{#people}} and I decided to go and have a look at the “clear-outs”. At first it was rather haphazard, but later, from the 1990s on, we made a regular practice of attending those clear-outs, and it slowly became our passion. From the very beginning, when rummaging through the garbage, we took home every object related to photography: cameras, negatives and printed photos. Over time we formed relationships with others like us who collected something specific, as we did. Sometimes we bought photos and scrapbooks from homeless people. During those years we found photos thrown away by hundreds of families. The majority of them were on negatives, but a few thousand were on paper. With time, our collection had become rather chaotic; none of us knew its precise content, and we had no clue at all what was on the negatives. In 2009, we agreed to look through all of them and try to scan them. At least we, the collectors, should know who or what was in the photos. Over the next year I spent almost each and every night scanning and cutting photos. My only companions in this phase of work were (PJ Harvey|PJ Harvey):{{#people}}, (Cat Power|Cat Power):{{#people}} and other rock musicians, whose records I listened to.

During these long nights I had plenty of time to think carefully about what we should do with the thousands of photos we had acquired. It was obvious from the very beginning that the Internet would be the optimal solution. The first idea that (Ákos|Szepessy, Ákos):{{#people}} and I had was to set up a website where all of our photos could be seen and searched on-line, as in a depository. At the time it seemed to be a handy solution, because we thought that each and every photo was important. But after reconsidering the first few hundreds of the images we had, we both felt that the collection was full of uninspiring, sad, and also disturbing photos that seemed to ruin the really important ones, of which there were much less. In other words, if we wanted to have a collection we were emotionally involved with, we would have to personally select it from amongst the many photos we had acquired. So in parallel with scanning, we started the selection process. We kept only the ones that we decided were “good.” We realized that this was a somewhat vague category, so we decided to clarify and describe the character of Fortepan in the following way: as a collection photos that we would like to remember and make others remember. So everything that we would like to forget won’t be seen. I know very well that this attitude is unacceptable to an archivist, but that is what we chose to undertake, and it gives a very special charm and character to the website. By the spring of 2010 we had thousands of “good” digitized photos ready for display. The aforementioned long nights with (Cat Power|Cat Power):{{#people}} and (PJ Harvey|PJ Harvey):{{#people}} gave me time to think of the next steps. After browsing the Internet looking for similar collections, we determined the following:

Firstly, the photo, as such, should be at the centre of our website. It is the photo that should be the focus, presented in the biggest possible size, because that is what we wanted to show – that’s what it’s all about. Ideally, the effect we would like to produce is one of attraction between the photo and the viewer. That is why we decided to have only one photo visible at a time, without any references or comments. We wanted a very simple, uncomplicated website.

The second thought was to make all the photos downloadable. This was not an easy decision; the collection is after all the result of 20 years of work and many thousands Forints. To be honest, we often thought that we could make some money from this enterprise. During these discussions we would remember ourselves of 10 or 20 years before, how angry we were when we were informed how much a museum would charge to publish a photo from their collection. We realized that we wanted the opposite: our aim was that everyone should be able to use our photographs, for any purpose, at any time, without any control. Even without our permission. To reach this goal, the “original” photo, in high resolution, had to be available for download.

The third thing we decided is the most difficult one to explain: we wanted to show the photos as linked or connected to each other. In other words, we wanted to make a film or write a novel using the pictures: watching a slide show of the photos should simultaneously suggest a connection between them. We were not interested in the thematically separated units of what we call a gallery approach. This method would have been the most simple to realize. Take the example of family photos: we could have kept the different family scrapbooks and negatives together and the photos could have been presented with each family as a separate gallery. The problem with this attitude was that the origin of many photos was completely unknown to us, as they did not belong to any album, or were single photos without a pair. This method also would have kept the photos separate, without the feeling of continuity and connection. So we had to discover a systemic method that somehow produced cohesion in a collection of photos with no common origin. Hence, the time scroll, or chronological slider.

    "Ca. 1940. Courtesy of Fortepan.hu.",

The time scroll is the only original idea of the Fortepan website, something we invented ourselves. We understood that from our collection were able to select and put on display even as many as ten thousand photos (which we now have). The solution we invented – to just put all images in chronological order – could then provide an immediate guideline for search as well, time becoming our only search tool. The reader could select the year by using a button. While using the website this solution might seem obvious and maybe even trivial, but it only occurred to us after processing thousands of photos. At the time, we had no idea that the time scroll or chronological slider would become be the most characteristic element of the whole collection, or that people would like the Fortepan collection because of this feature. You can easily jump from one year to another while leaving the photos in order; but it feels as if you were searching for something in an attic or suitcase. The depth of the collection is difficult to perceive; it feels endless, as though anything could happen, you could come across photos of your grandparents or even yourself.

The fourth principle relates to the future of the collection, and specifically, how to safeguard its specific character. We both agreed that the collection should be enriched and enlarged. Everybody should be welcome to donate a photo. But we did not want it to become automatic. We stood against the recent general trend of all inclusive archiving. We are not particularly concerned with the exact number of photos in the Fortepan collection. While we welcome any photos from the past, we retain the right of selection. I know this is, to a certain extent, radical or even selfish. The only way to make the readers accept the unacceptable is to reiterate our desire to create a collection that really fascinates the reader. The high standard of quality justifies the right to select. It is as if someone would occasionally insert new pages into a novel while keeping the continuity of the story.

The above mentioned four principles:

1. The photo should be the focus
2. All photos downloadable for free
3. Time as organizational principle
4. Expandable and flexible, but edited collection

As can be seen immediately upon entering the site, we had to insert a few menu options. First of all, we had to introduce ourselves and the collection in a few sentences, to make it clear for readers that it is not a selection from a state owned museum’s collection. This text can be found by clicking on “Fortepan.” This screen also provides a short history of the collection. The following 3 buttons work as a filter; we created three thematic groups that the photos could easily be put into: People, Objects and Places. Since an overlapping is unavoidable – for example there are photos in which both the person and the place are very characteristic – the same photo can be put into several categories (thanks to recent statistical figures, we know that the most popular thematic filter is “Places”). The 6th button is “New.” Here one can find the most recent additions to the website. Usually 1000–1500 new photos are put on the website every other month, so a separate menu entry for those seemed appropriate.

The most interesting element of the menu options is the search. In the early days of the website, the collection was not searchable, as we had no data about the photos. Sometimes we had the data, but did not feel like typing it in, having neither time nor the energy. Priority was given to the photos as visual objects. Less attention was paid to the content, though we knew very well that more people would be interested in exactly that. We were prepared for questions like: Do you have photos of Buda Castle? Will I find a photo of (János Kádár|Kádár, János):{{#people}}, a football match, Zeppelin balloon, synagogue, etc.? And even more complicated ones like, do you have photos in your collection of a “Raketa” vacuum cleaner, Skoda car, or luxury model Skoda 100, or Orion color TV? These were questions we could not answer; maybe we would remember something, but were unable to find the photo, or we could only find it by accident. We were prepared for these questions, but at that time we did not know yet that we wouldn’t have to answer them.

As I mentioned earlier, we do not catalogue the photos. They are put into one of the three thematic groups of People, Objects or Places with the year of creation. (The way we research the year could be the topic of another extensive paper.) In autumn 2010, three days after the website became publicly available, the forum of the leading Hungarian Internet news portal contacted us asking for our approval to launch a new project of identifying the Fortepan photos. Of course we were very glad. This Forum still operates and has become more professional. We have received about 7000 captions for our photos since the project launched. The members of the Forum identify not only the places but the objects as well. They carefully edit the text themselves and send it to us. We have nothing to do but copy and paste the descriptions onto the right photo.

The search engine searches these descriptions. It is very useful to those who are interested in certain topics, such as Budapest or Berlin. In the first week or two after the website became publicly available it became evident that its visitors had an enormous knowledge: about urban history, fashion, automobiles, ships or church history. They very much enjoy analyzing and describing the photos. We would have made a fatal mistake had we not involved these people and their knowledge in the project. The texts we’ve received have contributed immeasurably to the site.

I would like to say a few words about the names that can be seen in the bottom left corner of the website. Today the Fortepan collection contains approximately 10.000 photos, so in 6 months we doubled the original number of images. There are two sources of this expansion. Part of it comes from scanning images from our own collection. The second source has to do with those names. Early on it turned out that there were people who wanted to share their family photos with our assistance. They accepted and agreed with the above mentioned subjective selection condition and so we became the ones who take care of their photos. In practice this means that every week someone contacts us asking if she or he could send us some photos, and also asks to meet with us. The most important issue is the copyright, which is discussed with the donor at the outset of our cooperation. Fortepan’s copyright policy means that anyone can download the photos for any reason, even for commercial use. This is extremely important to the donor or collector, as we put high resolution versions of his/her photos on the website, and it could happen that this person later finds his/her parents or fairy cycle or dog, on a CD cover or poster.

It is worth mentioning that this copyright issue has not prevented anyone from donating yet. We were very much surprised by this, but it is true. Thus far, professional collectors and vendors are the only ones who do not want to participate in the project because of copyright issues. My personal opinion about their attitude (their photo will become valueless if it is downloadable) is that the value of an old photo can sometimes grow as a result of becoming well known. Since the one on display in Fortepan is only a copy of the original, the “real” photograph as material object stays with the owner. If only the owner knows about a photo, it will have no pecuniary value, since there isn’t anybody who would like to buy it. The popularity and reputation of Fortepan might help to find the right collector, one who will pay a really good price for the original photo. Since our collection is generally not based on authorship, its market value is decided by the topic or subject. A collector looking for synagogue photos will want to buy the original photo – the digital copy is not sufficient. She or he will buy it, not from us, but from the original owner, whose name is indicated in the info section below the photo. My personal opinion is that the publication of private collections in Fortepan could be a good investment.

Returning to donors and names, I would like to introduce one more function. Since Fortepan in certain cases appears to be a family archive, we thought that donations should be available in a separate section. Now, thanks to a recent development, names can be clicked and the photos of a certain family can appear separately on the same time scroll, or chronological slider. This has many advantages: the reader can thumb through the scrapbook of a certain family, and the donor can show family photos to his/her family members and friends while keeping his Fortepan “membership.”

However, there are more hints of authorship in our archive. Not long ago (Tamas Urban|Urban, Tamas):{{#people}}, a retired press photographer, contacted us and said that he would like to send us a few hundreds of his photos. First we were surprised, as oeuvres of photographers are usually processed by the Museum of Hungarian Photography in Kecskemét, but after a while we accepted his first few series. Tamás had two reasons for choosing us: on one hand he knew that the near future the Museum will have no interest in his oeuvre (although he is a World Press Photo winner) and on the other he likes the idea of high resolution and free use. This was surprising to hear from a professional photographer, but there are others who feel the same as Tamás does. He felt that his primary interest was that his photos be in use and grow popular, which would be completely impossible in museum and royalty circumstances. I am sure that there will be others who will follow his example, and every year Fortepan could host new oeuvres.

Let me share some details of the website’s reception. According to statistics, the site receives 600–900 visitors per day. They generally spend 15 minutes on the website, and I am completely satisfied with this figure. In this 15 minutes a reader can browse through approximately 100 photos, so around 60 000 photos are looked at daily. The number of visitors of the website generates different kinds of continuities, and so we were very glad to see “our” pictures in articles, advertisements, books and calendars, on the web or on CD covers. In fact, the reception of the Fortepan website has vastly exceeded our expectations; after almost every expansion, articles about us appear in the most popular Internet media. What still surprises me is that users cite us in their publications, which is very kind of them. What is more, people devote their spare time to think of captions to our photos; middle aged or elderly people personally bring their family photos to us; journalists send us copies of their newspapers. If someone spends 15 minutes searching Fortepan, then maybe he comes to understand the mission of the founders.

It also seems that nearly all of our visitors appreciate the fact that some individuals made their collection available to the public, spending their nights scanning and selecting photos without receiving any payment. Others appreciate it that the final result is downloadable free in high resolution without even having to send an email, simply by clicking on the “Download” button. Still others have memories and experiences of photo archives of public institutions and their slow, expensive, badly catalogued and bureaucratic mode of operation, and this mode seems a viable alternative to them. And last but not least, there are people who simply believe that not everything in our lives has to be about money.

I would like to finish by saying something about feedback from official and professional groups. In the first two months after the website became publicly available, we did not receive any professional feedback, neither good nor bad. Then the first reaction came, from (Károly Kincses|Kincses, Károly):{{#people}}, the founder and former director of the Museum of Hungarian Photography. His touching and moving thoughts were as much inspiring as they were overwhelming. In his view, Fortepan rewrote and redefined everything. In his view, the history of national photo archives would henceforth be divided into pre-Fortepan and post-Fortepan eras. This does not mean that he was satisfied with everything, but he wanted to indicate that the effect of our initiative is much bigger than what a few thousands photo as such could generate. After participating in a few professional roundtable talks, I think that Fortepan will not have any real effect on public collections. Unfortunately, it is entirely possible that archives of public institutions, with their slow and circumstantial staff, will continue to operate in parallel with our free, voluntary and community based archive for years to come. The present legal environment and financial expectations of public institutions make it impossible to open collections and make them free to access. This is even more revolting if we think of the collections that were established during the Communist regime with government support. My favorite example is the photo archive of the Hungarian News Agency, where today they make us pay for a photo taken in 1965 for tax-payers’ money.

Will Fortepan continue to exist, will there be new functions on the website, how long will we (and the server) be able to run the program? Hard to say. Or easy, maybe. We have been collection photos for 23 years, so most likely that will not change. There is nothing more fantastic than to see a 60 year old negative developed for the first time. I am very lucky that I could share this feeling, and that these forgotten but saved photos can be now seen in the window of a florist’s shop, or on the wall of a teenage girl’s room. That is enough to encourage us to once again spend our nights in the sole company of (PJ Harvey|PJ Harvey):{{#people}} or (Cat Power|Cat Power):{{#people}}.
