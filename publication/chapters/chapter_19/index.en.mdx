summary: "Two projects by Lucia Nimcová, Unofficial and Leftovers, share a similar point of departure: the archival images, found by the contemporary photographer, were taken in the time and place of her childhood. In the case of Unofficial, these are photographs by Juraj Kammer, who worked as an official photographer in the Regional Cultural Centre in Humenne, Czechoslovakia, during the 1980s, which involved the obligation of documenting all “important events” from the life of the local community. Leftovers contains photographic material from the same time period which, however, has never been used by the photographer, Marián Kusík – an amateur from Humenne and an acquaintance of the artist’s parent’s friends. Thus, from the very beginning, the artist’s relationship to the photographic archives she has appropriated is very personal: they provide her with a visual layer of memories from times when “she did not yet apprehend the world as a photographer;” at the same time, due to this relationship she feels entitled to judge them or even appropriate them with the confidence of a native. She already speaks from the position of a native and a participant of the worlds photographed in the first of the two books of the respective projects, where she juxtaposes her portrait as a girl with a camera hanging on her neck (taken in 1987 by Marián Kusík) with photographs by the “official” photographer, Juraj Kammer, with her own captions."

# The Right to the Use of the Archive

<Author link="/chapter_22">Ewa Klekot</Author>

In a way, any user of an archive always discovers the archive for herself, though the strategy of discovering that she adopts results to a large degree from the relationship – already existing or being formed in the process – between the user and the maker of the archive. The power relation, so obvious in the case of a state institution and a disciple of historical knowledge, and described so vividly by Nicholas Dirks:{{^1}}, can be absolutely subverted: in the case of a small private collection – or collections that have ceased to be important from the point of view of the authorities – the archive can end up at the mercy of its user and interpreter. The fact who those users are and the identity of the maker of the archive is crucial for its future. The relationship between the people involved with the archive in its early days with those who are discovering it for themselves later on rarely lacks emotion; the more it is full of dislike or delight, anger or gratitude, the more important the reason why a “discoverer” decides to interpret this particular archival collection.

Two projects by Lucia Nimcová, _Unofficial_ and _Leftovers_, share a similar point of departure: the archival images, found by the contemporary photographer, were taken in the time and place of her childhood. In the case of _Unofficial_, these are photographs by Juraj Kammer, who worked as an official photographer in the Regional Cultural Centre in Humenne, Czechoslovakia, during the 1980s, which involved the obligation of documenting all “important events” from the life of the local community. _Leftovers_ contains photographic material from the same time period which, however, has never been used by the photographer, Marián Kusík – an amateur from Humenne and an acquaintance of the artist’s parent’s friends:{{^2}}. Thus, from the very beginning, the artist’s relationship to the photographic archives she has appropriated is very personal: they provide her with a visual layer of memories from times when she “did not yet apprehend the world as a photographer;”:{{^3}} at the same time, due to this relationship she feels entitled to judge them or even appropriate them with the confidence of a native. She already speaks from the position of a native and a participant of the worlds photographed in the first of the two books of the respective projects, where she juxtaposes her portrait as a girl with a camera hanging on her neck (taken in 1987 by Marián Kusík) with photographs by the “official” photographer, Juraj Kammer, with her own captions.

The two protagonists of Lucia Nimcová’s projects provide her not only with very diversified archival material – in Kammer’s case, the collections of official photographs, mostly forgotten in the cupboards of the corridors of the Regional Cultural Centre in Humenne; in Kusík’s case, his collection of “leftovers,” i.e. imperfect, defective images, mostly taken as a “warm-up” at the beginning of a session, which a subject and a client were never supposed to see – but also with two different photographic biographies: that of a schooled photographer and that of an amateur. When reproducing Kammer’s photographs, Nimcová adds her own captions and commentaries, mostly very critical of the reality documented. At the same time, their juxtaposition with a self-portrait of the photographer places him in an ambiguous position, because it is so different from the rest of the works, whose author seems to be disengaged with what he photographs, bored, as if sunk in lethargy; only in the self-portrait the man ceases to be a “human form” which differs little from a desk or shop shelf. Anyway, these people photographed neutrally, as if from the outside, reduced to the form of gestures and bodily positions, have become an inspiration for Lucia Nimcová’s own works. They accumulated into a critical commentary on Kammer’s photographs, included in the second book of the project, entitled *Unofficial*. The video works from the same project are a similarly constructed commentary on gestures and their expression or lack thereof. Thus, from the very beginning, the artist – not only through the selection itself and the layout of the photographic material, but also through her own voice – does not allow Kammer to speak to the contemporary viewer without her own intervention. Marian Kusik is treated in a different manner – the images from his archive (even though clearly selected and arranged by Nimcová) are accompanied by the photographer’s own voice; the book begins and ends with his recollections, while the commentaries in the middle do not reveal the author, even though we know we hear Kusik’s voice as well as that of Nimcová and Michal Moravčik, who are trying to communicate the “zeitgeist of their generation.”:{{^4}}

Through the use of the photographic archives, Nimcová thus undertakes a sentimental journey to the time of her childhood by juxtaposing the images recorded by both photographers with her own vision of that time. Fascinated by her discoveries, the artist tries to address contemporary, surrounding reality through her own works, which appropriate the archival material. The material selected from the archives forms stories that establish continuity between the time of the recollections and that of the present. However, Lucia Nimcová does not create an elevating identity narrative where the heroic past should be the pride of the present. Quite the contrary – according to her diagnosis, the past emptiness of official gestures has imperceptibly found continuity in the present one, thus confirming the persistence of habitual bodily positions, while the past kitschy cosiness of the unofficial has not found its continuation in any contemporary form of the domestication of reality. It might be that this rupture is a result of the fact that today we do not need a photographer to take pictures of our kids. We record the intimacy of our home interiors without any mediators. The archive of a contemporary photographer will thus not grant us access to the zone of privacy that was visited by Marián Kusik.

The first procedure applied in the archives used by the artist is selection. In the case of Kusik’s “leftovers,” the choice is subordinated to Nimcová’s own memories and the memories of Michal Moravčik, invited by her to co-operate in the project, who like her belongs to the generation of “Husák’s Kids.” This generational identity is clearly suggested by the artist, and at the same time, she distances herself from the ideological reality behind it by adding the following commentary:

> Husák’s Children. It was a baby–boom generation. Thanks to robust family planning incentives, about a million children were born between 1970 and 1979 […] The marriage rate in Czechoslovakia reached record levels. In those days ninety–five per cent of people got married. That doesn’t make much sense, considering that every population has at least three per cent homosexuals, three per cent people with mental disorders and three per cent people with severe disabilities. To put it simply, there is at least ten per cent of the population who are not of marriage material, and still ninety–five per cent of the population was getting married”, says the Czech sociologist Ivo Možný.:{{^5}}

Through Kusik’s photographs and accompanying captions, Nimcová is trying to show the absurdity of the ideological implications of the reality of the 1980s in Czechoslovakia and grant it the dimension of privacy, thus searching for a sphere liberated from the ideology. The privacy is celebrated mostly (though not exclusively) at home and with family, in the space free of the empty forms of official expression that can be seen in Kammer’s photos depicting the sphere of public activities. What corresponds to these two realms of memories – private and public – are the various constructions of Nimcová’s works: in _Leftovers_ it is the narrative of recollection inspired by family photographs looked at together; in _Unofficial_ – critical formal experiments.

The two authors of the photographic archives used by Lucia Nimcová had recorded the world treated by the artist as her own past in two different ways. One of them was portraying it in the form of commemorative images to be placed in an album or sent to friends or relatives, the other was commissioned to document it by local authorities. Kusík’s archive is a portrait of the privacy of the inhabitants of a provincial town in the Czechoslovakia of the times of Husák *à rebours* – *à rebours* because Nimcová uses images that have never been shown by their author, nor were they sold to his clients – “failed” portraits; images “imperfect” as photographs. Their “failure” is additionally intensified by the feeling of intimacy: in one “failed” portrait, the baby photographed in the hallway of the family house has an unambiguous stain on the crotch, in another one the bumper of the pedal vehicle where a slightly older boy is proudly presenting himself is falling off; this failure can be a “wrong” face or a toy which covers half of the face. The “artistic failure” of the photographs lies mostly in their unsatisfactory composition: Kusík was facing the difficult task of composing photographs in the chaos of Humenne’s home interiors from the time of real socialism taking into consideration their various, symbolically meaningful, elements. The compositional chaos of the “leftovers,” as well as the intimacy additionally introduced by their imperfection, correspond to one of the two visions of the decline of real socialism in Czechoslovakia that Nimcová is trying to convey – the one lacking continuation in the present.

The artist has made the selection of Kammer’s archive according to a totally different idea. When one watches the choice of Kammer’s photos (complemented by one photograph by Pavel Šupinski and one by Ivan Varchola), and then the book made of images taken by Nimcova, as well as her video works inspired by Kammer’s photographs, it seems that the main criterion of her choice was the form of the human body in these images – its gestures, postures, position – and the emptiness of this form. The body, which by its posture expresses nothing that could be a message from its inside, but responds solely to the requirements of the environment where it has been placed. In her works Nimcová invites people to the very same interiors or to the same landscape where they were photographed by Kammer and observes their gestures, movements and positions. The situation shapes the body, which itself becomes a kind of empty form.

In an article on the Soviet hegemony of form, Alexei Yurchak:{{^6}} writes about the _ideological form_ that, due to its faithful reproduction, enabled changes leading to the fall of the Soviet totalitarian system, simultaneously disabling the perception of these changes as they were taking place. The system used to treat the solid form as a guarantee of its own safety, assuming that by excluding (or controlling) changes to the form, it could exclude or control any essential change.

> Ideological forms were not just Copied but perfectly replicated, which made them frozen and context–independent […] this replication was accompanied by a transformation of the meanings for which ideological forms stood in different contexts […] this process took place not only at the level of ideological texts, but also in other discourses of ideology: visual (posters, films, monuments, architecture), ritualistic (meetings, reports, celebrations) and in centralized formal structures of everyday practice.:{{^7}}

Lucia Nimcová seems to find in Kammer’s pictures precisely such ritualised, solid forms of bodily postures, not so much acquired during the regular training that was supposed to drill the protagonists of the photographs to a particular discipline, re-enacted as “an epitome” of presumably perfect replicas of the forms observed during central meetings, conventions and celebrations. What is also crucial here is the fact that Kammer’s archive consists of “good” images chosen by the photographer himself that he handed over as documentation to his employer, the Regional Cultural Centre in Humenne. Good, i.e. those that, according to their author, met the expectations of the client. The emptiness of the form that Nimcová treats as a challenge is a response to the expectations of the provincial culture officials.

However, when dealing with Kammer’s archival photographs, Nimcová does not limit herself to polemics with the past, but also offers a diagnosis of the present situation of Humenne and its inhabitants. Her diagnosis is as follows: forms of bodily activities have not changed; the official space has not changed. A meeting devoted to democracy in Nimcova’s photo looks just like the party’s meeting in Kammer’s photo. However, the private sphere photographed by Kusik did not live up to a similar reinterpretation. According to the artist, the ideological form is still omnipresent in the small world of the provincial town in Slovakia; what has disappeared however is the private sphere where, under the stiff corset of ideological form, changes were taking place that enabled the fall of the system. In Nimcova’s works, privacy belongs solely to the realm of nostalgic past – there is no commentary on the shape of Humenne’s present day privacy. This might be because, observing reality from the perspective of another system (although she suggests in her works that not much has changed in Humenne), she sees her role as photographer differently from the authors of the archives appropriated by her: for her the public sphere is the realm of her activity and it requires a real engagement and not an empty form. The private sphere, on the other hand, is for Nimcová not so much an alternative “human” dimension of a world dominated by the totalitarian ideology, as a space where everyone is her/his own photographer.

This might be the reason why Lucia Nimcová talks of Humenne’s privacy only from the perspective of the past: now her private sphere lies beyond Humenne, and she ceased to be native in the same sense as she was when Marián Kusík was still taking photographs. Certainly, however, the inhabitants of Humenne take pictures for themselves. Today, in their home archives one would surely find many images depicting, with the same dose of pride, the protagonists equipped with the props of family well-being, just like those who posed for Kusík in the 1980s. However, for Nimcová, the privacy of the contemporary inhabitants of Humenne is somebody else’s life, and she would definitely find it more difficult to claim her right to the use of those archives.

{{^1}}:“The first time I entered an archive, I panicked. My historical zeal inexplicably vanished as I desperately stemmed a welling desire to exit immediately and search for the nearest pub. […] Most historians write history before they enter the archive, beginning their professional apprenticeship by using those secondary sources in libraries that are already contaminated by interpretation and selection. But even at the beginning, such sources establish their authenticity through referencing an archive that demarcates the partial and secondary nature of all sources from outsider. The archive is constituted as the only space that is free of context, argument, ideology – indeed history itself. Accordingly, historians can only become historians or write history once they have been to the archive. The originary arrival of the historian in the archive is much like the arrival of the anthropologist in the field – that threshold of disciplinary certification – the magical moment when the scientist-scholar sets down upon a shore that beckons with the promise that one can finally engage in the act of Discovery, at last come face to face with truth and the realm of unmediated facto.” Nicholas B.
