# There Is No Such Thing As a National Archive

<Author link="/chapter_22">Ariella Azoulay</Author>

*I would like to thank the organizers, who gave me this wonderful opportunity to speak about my archives at this important intellectual event with Akram Zaatari, whose work on archives I admire.*

I would like to present, very briefly, the two archives that I created, or curated; I’m not sure which verb to use in this context, when the archives in question are not given but somehow invented, initiated. Through my presentation of these two archives and the logic behind them, I’ll introduce the concept of “potential history” that I slowly shaped through the work of assembling, viewing, classifying and reading these photos. Before I begin, however, some background is needed: I was born in Israel, and as with most Israeli Jews, the full story of the creation of the State of Israel was hidden from me, although we lived among innumerable traces that should have led us to ask questions. When we did eventually ask, the meagre answers we received already presupposed that the Palestinians were the enemy that threatened to destroy “our” state. Within this frame of enmity, the ruination of Palestine became invisible. Neither the ruination of Palestinian society nor that of the mixed society that existed in Palestine prior to ’48 was visible. When I started to research this period, what became clear to me from the very beginning was that I should not allow the contours of the Nakba – the Palestinian disaster – to frame my field of vision, as the Nakba, understood not as a civil catastrophe but as a Palestinian catastrophe, was already the result of the constituent violence that divided every single detail of that reality into either Palestinian or Israeli.

A short glance at a series of maps is necessary (See Il. 1). It shows the transformation of Palestine into Israel. In 1946 we see a concentration of Jewish populations in a few areas, always in propinquity with Palestinians, who comprised the majority of the population and occupied most of the land. The UN’s destructive partition plan of 1947 proposed a map that had little to do with the reality on the ground. In the third map one can see the outcome of what I’ll present as the “constituent violence” that enabled the State of Israel to gain, by force, vast areas of land that even according to the partition plan were allocated to Palestine. In the last map, we can see the current situation where the Palestinian area has become completely fragmented.

In my work, through the use of photography and its articulation within an archive, I’m trying to re-conceptualize the tools we inherited from political philosophy, tools that are responsible for monstrous plans and figures such as “partition,” “refugees,” “state sovereignty,” etc., in order to create new concepts to narrate history differently. My archives of potential history are inspired by (Hannah Arendt|Arendt, Hannah):{{#people}} and her understanding of the various domains of the Vita Activa, and by (Walter Benjamin|Benjamin, Walter):{{#people}} and his notion of “incomplete history.” Let me start by showing the materialization, in space, of the first archive that I created – _Act Of State 1967–2007_ (Il. 2 and 3). 1967 is the beginning of the occupation of the West bank and Gaza, and the other is the deployment in space of the second – _Constituent Violence 1947–1950_ (Il. 4) or _From Palestine to Israel – Destruction and State Formation_. This one relates to the four formative years in the creation of state of Israel. The first archive was organized in a continuous timeline that was constantly interrupted by the thematic lines of 3–4 photos that present various phenomena. The other mode of existence of the archive is the book (Il. 5). I don’t want to dwell on the images of the archive, but rather to present the theoretical, political or civil questions that preoccupied me while building it.

## Act of State 1967–2007

Once I started to work on this archive of the “occupation,” a few general questions imposed themselves as limits that should be problematized and eventually transgressed. These questions related to **time** – the meaning of imposing 1967 as a starting point; to **space** – the impossibility of limiting the collection only to what is defined as the “occupied territories”; and to the **body politics** – the impossibility of splitting the two populations – Israeli Jews as occupiers and Palestinians as occupied. Through an arbitrary sequence of images, I’ll try to develop those three aspects of the problem in question. This image, in which you see Palestinian workers, was not taken in the occupied territories but rather in Petach Tikwa, which is 15 minutes from Tel Aviv, where I live (Il. 6). The driver in the car is an Israeli citizen looking for cheap labour on a daily basis. In this image (Il. 7), you could mistakenly take this figure with a gun for a Palestinian and this one for an Israeli, but this alleged Palestinian is what is called in hebrew “mista’arev:” an Israeli soldier pretending to be Palestinian in order to infiltrate a Palestinian environment. These limitations and partitions can be undermined by a careful reading of the photographs and their articulation within the archival space. These three limits/constraints are responsible for the containment of the occupation as something that takes place “out there,” outside of the Israeli democratic regime, as if the wall of separation can really separate that which is intermingled in so many ways. During my work on this archival project, the most important question became how to make present these modes of partition and separation, and to account for them without letting them determine the limits of the visual field created by my archive. I had to choose between two options: either eliminate these constraints, as I found them completely false, or make them visible, archive them, as they play a predominant role in the reproduction of the occupation and thus are part of the Israeli political regime. I sought a way to force the discourse of the occupation that usually conditions our field of vision to become visible within the field of vision created by my archive. This shift enabled me to track down the way that the discourse of the occupation created and creates its objects as, for example, the figure of the occupied person. Once this shift is achieved, the “occupied person” cannot be perceived as obvious anymore, and questions like “what is this abnormality?” are applied to many of the terms that are currently in use: “occupied person,” “occupation,” “refugee,” “wanted person” or “silent occupation.” I didn’t conceive of the archive as simply a collection of items, but rather as a “surface of appearance” that is created by the items collected in it and by the way that they are archived. A surface of appearance, as (Foucault|Foucault, Michel):{{#people}} claims in his book _Birth_ _of_ _the Clinic:{{^1}}_, determines what can be seen in an archive.

The archive is composed of photos and relatively long captions. Through the captions, suspending national dichotomies I try to make visible what could otherwise continue to be articulated in the language of power that determines who is citizen and who is subject, and consequently which violence is justified and legitimate and which is not. Here, for example, in this photograph (Il. 8): the governing power might describe it as an arrest, of course justified, as Palestinians were a threat to order. I try to pay attention to the conditions of the arrest and their meaning. If one looks carefully at this photograph, one sees a third soldier behind the Palestinian and the two Israeli soldiers. He uses the clubs he wields to chase away a crowd of young Palestinians who could be there as witnesses, as those who together constitute a public sphere. They are expelled from the public realm and thus, the possibility that they will relate differently to the situation at hand is excluded in advance. The lesson they are expected to draw from this situation is that they should avoid any act of resistance to the governing power that dominates them as non-citizens. Thus, instead of looking at this picture and saying “this is an arrest” or “this is a Palestinian arrested by Israeli security forces,” in this photo I read the traces of procedures Israeli security forces use to create what they call “quiet occupation.” Thus the “quiet” achieved through the abrogation of a public sphere comes to the foreground. There is another photograph from which a similar situation can be reconstructed (Il. 9). This photo intrigued me and I put it on my desk. One day I had something akin to a memory flash to when I was the age of the young pupils in the photograph, and only then did I understand what I saw in the picture. I saw myself walking back from school with my classmates: we were always in groups. Now note the artificial distance that separates these pupils from one another – at least one meter intervals separate them. They walk that way because they are obeying a regulation. When I understood the photo it was much easier to understand what to look for in order to assert my hypothesis. And indeed, I found regulations prohibiting Palestinians from gathering in public. In the first years of the occupation, Palestinians were not allowed to assemble in the streets. Here, through the body language of young Palestinians, I was able to reconstruct the way that the governing power achieved what it called “quiet occupation.”

Viewing and re-viewing the photos gathered in the archive, I didn’t look at them as representations of the “photographed event,” but rather as records of what I call “the event of photography.” In this event, as an Israeli Jew, I’m not only a spectator; I’m also implicated in and affected by the event. Since the very beginning of my work on this archive, I looked for ways of archiving the occupation as being part of the same political regime that governs Israeli citizens, albeit differently. I tried to show the continuity of the Israeli regime along the three axes mentioned above.

### Space

Photo 10 can be seen as an allegorical photo of the occupation as if everything that is the occupation is – and will forever stay – enclosed behind a wall. This of course is a fantasy, an idealistic vision of citizens who commit or tolerate crimes that are somehow permitted in their own society as non–crimes, as long as they only affect Palestinians. But this is of course part of the fantasy – that crimes can affect only their victims – and that Israelis are protected by the wall of separation they have built. In this photo from 2007, we see Gaza behind a wall of darkness (Il. 11). In the archive, I’m looking for the zones and moments where this fantasy of a wall of separation is shattered, from which I reconstruct the numerous mechanisms of friction and control that enable the maintenance of this fantasy of separation. In this image (Il. 12), you can “architectonically” see the multiple zones of frictions that create the false image of a clear-cut separation of two entities. Look at this twisting snake, this monster’s tail that split families, cut villagers from their lands, pupils from their schools, people from their working places, etc.:{{^2}}

### Time

One of the main tools used by the political regime of the occupation is temporariness. It starts with the “occupation” as a whole being represented as being temporary. The common discussions about its eventual end or the various plans or ways to end it contribute enormously to its image as “temporary.” Listening to the media or to political conversations among Israelis, it seems that if this or that obstacle were removed, the way would be paved to end the occupation. What I try to show through the organization of the archive is that these “temporary” situations have actually been permanent since 1967. Another false conception related to time that I had to deconstruct in and through my archive was the common representation of the state’s coercion and violence as one-time episodes. Each destroyed house is exposed and “justified” as having its own particular reason: either its inhabitants are suspected terrorists, or the house was illegally constructed. Through the archive, the destruction of so many houses (since 1948 200,000 houses have been destroyed) appears differently than it does under the regime’s logic, which seeks to “individualize” the destruction and link each demolished house to a specific alibi. Through the archive we can see a systematic modus operandi. The question, though, is how to move from the “temporariness” or “one-time” episodes to their systematic recurrence. Note this check-point from the beginning of the occupation (Il. 13). It looks like a temporary one – it appears to just be a sign to stop for inspection. When you look at sequences of photos from the last decades, you can see how the language of temporariness is developed. Look for example at this photo (Il. 14). The permanent aspect of it cannot be denied, as well as the systematic repetition of “single” cases of violence toward Palestinians.

The last aspect of time that I problematise in the archive is its distinction from the Israeli regime constituted in ’48. Through every photo taken in one of the numerous refugee camps created in ’48, the year ’67 – the beginning of the occupation – seems more like another phase, and not like the beginning of an era of occupation (Il. 15). But consider this photo from ’71, taken in a refugee camp in Gaza. Already by saying “refugee camp,” we are participating in the naturalization of a phenomenon that should be articulated as an aberration. The refugee camps were created in ’48 to host, “temporarily,” the hundreds of thousands of Palestinians expelled from Palestine in order to create the state of Israel as a home for the Jewish people.

### Body Politic

In the eyes and language of the regime, the body politic is composed solely of citizens, while all the others being governed are constituted as “occupied persons,” “refugees,” “stateless,” “illegal” etc. In my archive, I try to re-configure the body politic differently by seeing the entire population living between the sea and the river as part of the body politic. Look, for example, at image 16 from ’68 taken in Tel-Aviv. I remember these situations from the 70s, when I used to take the bus to go to high school. A policeman or soldier entered the bus and only checked the papers of Palestinians, or those who looked Palestinian. This harassment of one population did not take place on another planet, nor under another regime – this was and is part of the Israeli regime. It can be seen in the image 17 too, taken near Gaza in 2009 in a place called “the journalists’ hill”. When Israel violently attacked Gaza in 2009, it built this “journalists hill,” a vantage point from which journalists could perceive the situation as a war between two sides, thus obliterating the context of the occupation. Journalists and other spectators were invited to see missiles coming from the Gaza side, while the bombardment from Israel was framed as a retaliation. In the photo you can see Israelis coming to visit the hill on Saturdays with their families. All are well-dressed, as if they are going to a celebration. In this photo, you can see Israelis taking photos of themselves and their relatives, with smoke from bombed neighborhoods in Gaza in the background. In this photograph we can see the invisibility of the disaster – the destruction of houses – to those Israeli families, and later on, to the spectators of their photos. Through the archive, I’m trying to articulate the oscillation of disaster between visibility or invisibility in a way that has little to do with what is seen and more to do with who is affected by the disastrous procedure as, for example, in the destruction of houses. Speaking about the body politic was not only a question of including the whole governed population into the archive, but also of reconstructing the split in the body politic between citizens and non-citizens as two opposing sides, where what happens to one of them, the Palestinians, cannot be perceived as a disaster by the other, the Israeli Jews. In the center of both this archive, _Act of State 1967–2007_, and the second, _Constituent Violence 1947–1950_, is what I call “regime-made disaster.” This is disaster produced and orchestrated by the regime in such a way that the subjection of part of the population is achieved through the transformation of the disaster inflicted upon the other part of the population as non-disaster. The signs and traces of the disaster are there, but they are becoming invisible (or have become invisible) for a certain part of the population. Thus, the destruction of 15,000 houses, which would be recognized as a disaster if it happened to the Israeli Jews, becomes a non-disaster, or invisible as such, when inflicted on the Palestinians.

What emerged through the archive that I constituted was not the occupation as a distinct phenomenon in time and space, but the template of a political regime in which the occupation plays a crucial role. Through this archive I was able to claim that the main characteristic of this political regime was the invisibility of the disaster to part of the population. Thus the disaster is articulated along populations that are ruled differently under the same regime. The regime is based on the administration of those who are governed as citizens and should be protected from disaster, and those are governed as non-citizens and are exposed to disaster. From this photo taken in Jerusalem in 1967 (Il. 18), we can reconstruct the presence of disaster and its invisibility to those who see its traces. Note the huge crowd of Israeli Jews coming to admire the Wailing Wall a few days after Jerusalem was conquered by the Israelis. The Wailing Wall is outside of the frame, but it is what the crowd stares at. They are standing in a vast plaza in front of the Wailing Wall. This plaza was not there a few days earlier – in order to create it, 200 old houses that were part of the Maghrebian quarter were destroyed. The destruction was not part of the war or battles, but part of what I call (following (Walter Benjamin|Benjamin, Walter):{{#people}}) “constituent violence.” In the left front side of the frame you can still see the rubbles of the Maghrebian quarter, ignored by the crowd admiring the Wailing Wall.

## Constituent Violence 1947–1950

The _Constituent violence 47–50_ archive is organized around the invisibility of disaster. This period of 1947–1950 is usually described by Israeli historians as a transition from a war between two sides to the creation of the state of Israel. Through the archive I’m trying to show that to use the term “war” without problematizing the series of the events, is to simply repeat verbatim the language of the victorious power that imposed its vision on reality. Through the photos I’m trying to show that the violence exercised at the time was constituent violence, violence that sought to impose a new demographic reality, or what the historian (Ilan Pappe|Pappe, Ilan):{{#people}} describes in his book as “ethnic cleansing.” War implies two sides of a national conflict. Through violence, the new regime succeeded in separating the population into two hostile sides. Historians who adopt the result of this violence – the separated population – as the cause of an “unavoidable conflict” are actually anachronistically projecting the language of the victorious power upon the past.

To create the second archive I had to suspend two narratives, the Zionist narrative of independence, culminating in the establishment of the State of Israel, and the narrative of the Nakba as a merely Palestinian catastrophe and history. The Nakba narrative presupposes and reproduces the split between the two national populations, as if they were really distinct, homogenous and hostile prior to ’47.

I claim that in these photos from ’47 to ’50, we are facing the very moment of the constitution of an unbridgeable divide between Jews and Arabs. I was intrigued by the possibility of reading these images, coming from the State Archive, against the grain. In photo 19 for example, we can see the implementation of one of the first borders in the area. Prior to ’48, Palestinians – Jews and Arabs alike – used to go to Beirut for vacations, or to Alexandria or Amman for their studies. The installation of the border physically, architectonically, and politically created a divide between Jews and Arabs. Borders never affect only one population. The official title of this photo from al-Nasirah reads “shop in Nazaret fills up with Jewish products.” (Il. 20) The author of this caption – be it the archivist or the photographer – was extremely proud of the predominance of Jewish products having the power to transform a Palestinian shop into a Jewish one. This inversion made such photos of dispossession easily accessible in state archives. Images similar to this one (Il. 21) can be found in the albums of many Israeli Jews: children who had been sent to schools in order to clear “abandoned villages” of stones. The “abandoned villages” are villages whose Palestinians residents were uprooted, and the pupils were mobilized to participate in “building the newborn state.” Through this shift from “war” as an organizing framework to constituent violence that creates regime-made disaster, I’m able to show how these violent events also unavoidably affected those who were involved in the creation of disaster or benefitted from it. Through the constituent violence of 1947–1950, the Jews lost the civil life they shared with Palestinians and their existence as non-perpetrators. In this archive I’m trying to create a new surface of appearance through which expulsion, distraction and dispossession appear as a catastrophe that affects the whole population involved in its production. Not only its immediate victims – the Palestinians – but also the Israeli Jews who become perpetrators, as well as the generation of descendants of these perpetrators, to whom I belong. Not recognizing the disaster of others dooms one to become – if not a perpetrator oneself – at least a tacit collaborator with perpetrators. By recognizing the claims of those who were the victims of those perpetrators, one participates in keeping the past incomplete in a way that past wrongs can be reversed, changed, recompensed. Only if the past is made incomplete can the victim claim her rights, and the perpetrator claim her own right – the right to not be a perpetrator.

## Conclusion

I want to conclude with the notion of “potential history.” Potential history should be understood in a dual sense. First, as the unrealized possibilities that motivated and directed the actions of various actors in the past. I’m referring here mainly to the vast collaboration between Jews and Arabs between 1947–1948 to avoid the burst of violence. I don’t have time to develop it further here, except to introduce this notion of civil common efforts to avoid the violence that were led by (Ben-Gurion|Ben-Gurion, David):{{#people}} and the Haganah in order to transform Palestine into Israel. The second feature of potential history relates to the possibilities that may become our own possibilities today, and be reactivated to guide our actions, and this is what guides me in creating this archive. The idea is to move from history as it has been shaped by the dominant perspective of the sovereign nation-state to a potential history insistent on restoring, inventing and imagining other forms of being together that existed at any moment in history without ever being exhausted by the national perspective imposed by the sovereign power.

Here is a photo from 1947, taken in the yard of the hospital in Haifa (Il. 22). One can see a few members of the hospital staff being photographed, probably by another colleague. This is an Armenian doctor, this one is a Palestinian doctor and among the three nurses, one is Jewish and two are Arabs. They worked together at the hospital and the photo gives a sense of the intimate and close relations among them. And in this photo (Il. 23) you see Margo, a Jewish resident of Palestine, with her Arab friend on her right, and her Jewish friend on the left. I think that (Akram|Zaatari, Akram):{{#people}} has a very similar image from Tel Aviv-Jaffa. This image (Il. 24) is from the Jewish parade (“Adleyada”) of Purim in Tel Aviv. In the crowd one can recognize the mixed presence of Palestinians and Jews.

Indeed, Jewish settlements didn’t represent only a threat and the fear of some of the Palestinians about Jewish immigration didn’t necessarily have to conclude in the violent way it did. And we have to look at this image in a nonteleological way, without projecting the expulsion of Palestinians that took place a few months later onto it, as if it was unavoidable. Living as neighbors, they had various exchanges and relations, including assisting each other in all sorts of endeavors. The fact that this tissue of relations occurred until the very last moment is the ultimate proof that the disastrous cleansing of Palestine was not the only option possible at the time. As can be seen here, Jews and Palestinians were working together to create this new colony. I’m not idealizing their relations. They might have been good or ambivalent, maybe exploitation was involved, but they were not doomed to be concluded with disaster. Note in image 25, captioned in the archive as “two cases of bladder stone,” the confidence of the Jewish boy toward the father of the Palestinian boy while all the three are being photographed. Or this photograph from El Alamein Coffee (Il. 26) at Al-Shaykh Muwannis, where Tel Aviv University is located today. It was a very popular café run by a Jew and an Arab, where a mixed population came to pass the time. Through these images one can see that as Jews and Arabs shared the same territory their relations took diverse and complex forms, and were organized by various interests that could never be represented purely along national dividing lines. Sharing the territory ontologically is sharing life. It’s not a matter of choice but a matter of fact. Let me present this through the last image (Il. 27). It is an image of violence, of people going to be expelled from their homes, of people driven out of the place they shared with those now expelling them. I want to claim, through this image, that by expelling them they do not stop sharing their lives with one another. On the contrary: the bond between them is even harder to untie, as the exchange was cut in a way that created an imbalance and excluded one from expressing his or her claims.

Using this image, I strive to reconstruct the constituent violence responsible for the partition of the two populations, for the expulsion of 700,000 Palestinians, and for the blindness of the Israeli Jews in relation to this catastrophe. The submission of Israeli Jews to this type of citizenship, one based on indifference to this disaster, was not achieved without violence and what (Achille Mbembe|Mbembe, Achille):{{#people}} calls “commandment.” Israeli Jews were commanded to be dumb and blind and to justify what is unjustifiable par excellence. Look at this image taken in Jerusalem (Il. 28). This is the moment of curfew and the military curfew is not imposed on Palestinians but on Jewish citizens, socializing them to the role of the army as a governing branch. She is a bit lost in the streets, looking for something, and she addresses the soldier, as he is the only one who can give answers at such moments of curfew. This photo (Il. 29) is from Tel Aviv, whose civil Jewish population was also under curfew for 7 days while 3,000 Israeli soldiers with dogs invaded houses to look for those who didn’t want to join the army. The military logic was imposed on the entire population. The Palestinians were literally under martial law, while the Israelis were interpellated to adopt military logic voluntarily and thus to perceive any harm inflicted upon Palestinians from a military point of view – as justified. Back to this image of al-Ramle: I want to claim that while the catastrophe inflicted upon the Palestinians was clearly that of transforming them into refugees, becoming perpetrators or descendants of perpetrators was the catastrophe that Israeli Jews inflicted upon themselves unconsciously or unwillingly. I claim that in viewing these images we cannot relate to them only in terms of what has been done to the Palestinians. What we have here is not only Palestinians and “their” catastrophe, because catastrophe can never really be partitioned between its generators and its victims. What we face through this photo is a situation of becoming refugees at the same time as becoming perpetrators. A new surface of appearance emerging from these archives enables us to account for the whole governed population in a new way; by narrating the past differently we can recognize, imagine or invent the unavoidable seeds of a future, a possible future where forgiveness can be asked as an invitation to reinstate together the threshold of the unbearable, of what should not be done, what should not be violated. I suggest that we see these photos as historical documents, where the moments of destruction are made incomplete in order for its participants to claim their share and pay their debts in such a way that co-existence becomes possible again.

If history is made incomplete, Palestinians’ claims of their right of return could become a shared obligation, or endeavor, in such a way that its fulfillment could absolve Israelis from their role as perpetrators.
