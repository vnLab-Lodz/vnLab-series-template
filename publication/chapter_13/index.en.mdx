summary: "As far back as I can remember, I’ve been collecting and preserving the past, and always felt a connection to photographs. They provide a flood of memories and connective emotions that direct and shape our lives, pushing us onward, ever forward. They remind us of what has been and allow us to simultaneously compare that with the present (provided we take special care to protect it for the future)."

# Archiving as a Metaphor for Life: A Slideshow

## Grayson Dantzic

  As far back as I can remember, I’ve been collecting and preserving the past, and always felt a connection to photographs. They provide a flood of memories and connective emotions that direct and shape our lives, pushing us onward, ever forward. They remind us of what has been and allow us to simultaneously compare that with the present (provided we take special care to protect it for the future).

  My first slide is of my great grandparents’ Myer & Leah Dantzic’s certificates of registration and it is stamped 11/13/1923. These old documents were given to my mother by my late Aunt Rae (on my father’s side). They are an important part of my identity, where my family tribe has been. I’ve always wanted to visit Gdansk, which used to be called Danzig, and I consider to be my ancient hometown. Hopefully on my next trip to Poland, I will be able to go.

  The next slide shows me being pushed in a baby carriage by my mother at age two and pointing at my father’s image of nuns walking by a destroyed old church in New York City. It was included in an important ASMP photography exhibition called “The City Seen” at Bryant Park in 1969. It was my first archival moment, and I seem to be saying “why isn’t this great photograph in a frame and behind some protective glass?!”

  The third slide, taken by my father a few years later, is a powerful self-portrait of us in his studio on West 33rd Street at the time. It is one of my favorites, and you can see that I’m holding onto him with both hands as I missed him already. He was always busy working with his photography, sometimes on assignment, or printing. It was only years later, when I realized how much I didn’t know about his life, and through the unfortunate illness that claimed his life in 2006, was I able to have the time to ask him about his life and gain some closure.

  The fourth slide is one of my father’s career highspots, as it is a double page spread from the 5/28/1978 issue of Time Magazine. This story was published in conjunction with his major one-person show at MoMA, at that time in New York called “Jerry Dantzic and the Cirkut Camera.” My father won many grants, including two Guggenheim Fellowships and an NEA Fellowship, and as a child I’d spent most of my summers travelling in a van with my parents, photographing every state in the USA. I always remembered this clipping, and when I was living in California in the early 1990s, I bought a copy at a bookstore and it reminded me of the importance of that moment in our lives. I love periodicals.

  My fifth slide is of my parents, Cynthia & Jerry Dantzic, me and Christopher Hunt, the director of the Adelaide Festival of the Arts in Australia, taken during the summer of 1979. My father had been hired on commission to create some of his large color panoramic photographs of Australia. Mr. Hunt had been introduced to my father’s work the previous year at the MoMA show, curated by John Szarkowski. Note my fingers only on the edge of the image, ever-archivally conscious.

These vignettes are among those that became the epiphanies that shaped my life and gave me the direction to become an archivist. And in 1999, when it became apparent that my father’s health was getting worse, I quit my job at the Plaza Hotel and dedicated myself to becoming his archivist. After all those years, I was finally allowed to look through his studio.
<br />
It was around this time that I started making contacts in the photographic community, and Mary Engel was among those who I consider to be one of my archival “gurus.” The daughter of two celebrated artists, I immediately connected to her, and we’d have talks about preservation, galleries and prints. I was also a friend of Morris Engel, her father. We were members of the PAI Photography club that met at the National Arts Club once a month for lunch and a lecture.
<br />
Within a few years, our discussions became more focused about archives and our need to connect and collect all of our resources, together with our similar friends with other archives. It was out of this apparent and obvious wealth of materials and excitement that the American Photography Archives Group was born.
<br />
There were many important questions to address at the start our meetings with regard to individual archives, such as organization, preservation and re-housing. Conversations between members were meticulous about which recommended archival boxes, mylar sleeves and gloves to use. In addition and in technical terms, how to establish databases, and the initial cataloguing of archival materials.

Further APAG topics ranged from numerous copyright issues to reprints, editions of prints, and gelatin-silver prints vs. digital printing. To ensure the longevity and maintenance of an archive is such a huge undertaking, one that requires a time commitment as well as finances. Integrity is essential to the core of such a task. APAG was formed to support its members and make their work more of a shared experience. With the best of intentions…archives are truly “labors of love.”
<br />
The membership of APAG currently includes over 75 prominent and historically significant photography archives, and also two foundations. I’ve selected five images from a selection of APAG photographers, just to give a glimpse of the type of work that it represents.
<br />
I returned to school in 2006, and received my MLS in Archives & Records Management from the Palmer School of Library and Information Science on the very day of my father’s funeral. Within a few weeks, I was working at the Atlantic Records Archives, and feeling all too connected to the fact that the president Ahmet Ertegun had died on the same day as my dad (12/14/2006).
<br />
I’ve been working at Atlantic for the almost 5 years now, and last year there was a major article in the New York Times about the Warner Music company’s archival initiative. I feel very blessed to have my job and be the preservationist for this great legacy of American Musical History. Archiving has been the metaphor for my life, in that by finding my father’s past, I was able to find my future.
