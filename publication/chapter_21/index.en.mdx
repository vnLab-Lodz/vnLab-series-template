**Marianna Michałowska:** To begin our discussion, I’d like to present, not so much an archive of the many topics discussed during the conference, as a kind of collection of subjects that resurfaced in successive presentations.

<br />

I’d describe this collection of subjects, not as a series of oppositions, so much as certain aporia, indeterminacies. In an archive, we aren’t dealing with an “either or” situation, but an “and and”. The problem of entropy and negentropy of archives, discussed by Wolfgang Ernst and Sven Spieker among others, provides a good representation of these aporias. The disappearance and dissolution of archival materials goes hand in hand with the need to preserve them. Entropy, tending towards a gradual extinction of energy, is inextricably linked to negentropy, or the energy necessary to life. Inasmuch as the first leads to archives being lost to time, the second leads to their persistence, and perpetual growth. Our speakers have repeatedly pointed out the unique role that artists and artistic works have played in revitalizing the archive. Nataša Petrešin spoke of the performativity of expository activities that extract works from the archive and return them to contemporary audiences. André Gunthert discussed conservation practices, which I would call negentropic, or aimed at disseminating collections.

<br />

We have repeatedly discussed questions connected to the construction of archives, and the process of making them available. As John Tagg showed in his introduction, making the machinery of the archive reflexive is a prerequisite to understanding current constructions of knowledge and the structures of power tied to them, which make decisions about the use of archival materials. The construction of knowledge has a political character and is always manipulated by the creator of the archive in some way. Who has access to the archive, and will it be equally available to everyone? How should we protect the rights of those who do not want their archives to be made publicly available? What legal solutions do we need to cope with problems of access? These questions were often repeated in the portion of the conference devoted to institutional archives, where presenters indicated varying situations related to digital archives or – like Wolfgang Ernst – proposed changes to terminology and categorization.

<br />

One cannot separate institutions and archival activities from deeply ontological topics, or the elementary question – what is an archive? Is it an ideological construction, as Allan Sekula wrote, constructed by people and institutions for a specific purpose? Or perhaps, as Paul Ricoeur described it in *History, Memory and Forgetting*<Annotation target=",">Paul Ricoeur, Kathleen Blamey, and David Pellauer, *Memory, history, forgetting* (University of Chicago Press, 2006).</Annotation> the archive calls to mind the *pharmakon*, which in itself is neither good nor evil? It is only later, when users remove materials from the archive, that they make them into something political.

<br />

This brings us to the question of interpreting archival materials. And again, we are faced with two perspectives. The first, presented by artists, encompasses both the creation of documents and the use of extant materials. Artists use these materials for self-creation, or to recognize hidden, previously unseen contents and meanings. The other perspective is represented by institutions, whose goal is to disseminate their collections and make them accessible, as well as to protect and conserve them. There is a strong connection between these two ends of the spectrum. Institutional activities are also tied to questions of ownership, publication and exhibition rights, and defining rules of usage. What rights, for example, does an artist working with an archive have to copy materials from it? Can he or she disclose everything?

<br />

I think a good entry point into discussion is Ariella Azoulay and Akram Zaatari’s project, “Archive as Potential History.” Could the construction of potential histories be an illustration of the conviction that the archival image is never innocent? Does an image’s involvement in historical discourses mean that even when we are building “potential histories,” we must demarcate our own position in relation to the problems presented?

## On the Politics of Building Archives and Collections

**Akram Zaatari:** As I explained earlier, *The Arab Image Foundation* did not inherit any material. I really don’t like to designate its collection as an archive; maybe with time, someone will designate it as such, but these are collections that came in a few pictures at a time, and they have gone through a process of very subjective selection by the people that brought them to the foundation. Their existence at the foundation is the outcome of an process of selection, primarily carried out by artists. Often they constitute just another aspect of their own art projects. The ambition of the foundation, whether it has been achieved or not, is to ask whether an art project can have a public facet. How does an art project change when other people are able to use the materials that went into making it? I always give the somewhat extreme example of a film maker who finishes a film but makes all the rushes available to the public for all sorts of uses. That’s why I don’t call it an archive.

<br />

I really don’t feel all that concerned about its position vis-à-vis politics. As an artist, of course I have a position, but the position of the collection, or the archive, is not my responsibility. I do my field work, and whatever comes out of it exists in two bodies; one is the archive of the *Arab Image Foundation*, and the other is a video, a film, a book, an exhibition, whatever. And that’s unique; I don’t know of another public collection that functions this way.

<br />

**Ariella Azoulay:** First of all, I think that there are no innocent images, but there are no criminal images. We have to think that images are fragments, and we articulate these fragments in other discourses, and discourses are always not innocent. But I do not think that we can classify images themselves as guilty, or as criminal.

<br />

What I tried to present in the potential history and the two archives that I created is that I suspect that the political philosophy with which we approach the images of our past is not at all innocent. And political philosophy – modern political philosophy mainly, and the use of terms like citizens, noncitizens, illegal persons, refugees, sovereignty – all these terms are situated in a knowledge that was produced in the 18th century. That allegedly universal language camouflaged a differential rule. It started in the French revolution with the exclusion of women, blacks and the poor, and was also in the American Revolution with the exclusion of slaves, women, etc. We inherited this discourse in our democracy, and in our approach to photography. And what I’m trying to do – not only in what I presented as case studies and specific archives, but in general with photography – is to claim that the practice and uses of photography enable us to reshape our political language and our political philosophy, to invent new concepts with which we can approach photography. And in doing so, we can account, not only for what was framed for us to see, but also for this practice of photography in which other populations who were always ruled differentially from us – whoever “us” and “them” may be – are also inscribed in the photographs.

<br />

Akram and I had two different talks, but somehow we arrived at the same wish, the same hope, the same force of imagination, the same political project. Although Akram just defined himself as an artist, and said that as an artist he doesn’t have a political vision, I think it’s very clear that we share the same political vision. I understand why he says he doesn’t have one, because – and now I’m coming back to what I was saying about reshaping political concepts, or political philosophy – I think that the way that we usually use these terms in relation to photography are not innocent. I think that what Akram is trying to do, in that sense, is not a political project, it’s an attempt at changing the terms, and this is where I think we share the same position.

<br />

**Krzysztof Pijarski:** I would like to continue further down this track and start my question at the exact point where you just left off. During your presentation, I had this feeling that you were working from two different positions towards the same, end, vision, or horizon, whose goal is the reinstatement of a kind of community in a place where there was division; to launch, if I may call it so, a “new beginning.” But the tools that you use are historical. Both of you approach each other facing backwards, in a way. Akram makes extensive use of oral history and archives, talks to people, works with memories and recollections, in order to recode a certain narrative, a certain reality, and you do the same. You work with archival pictures, trying to rewrite them. So do you think that the only way to go further is to work through this history, or rewrite this history, or come to terms with the “ghosts in your house?”

<br />

**Ariella Azoulay:** I’ll start with the term “new beginning.” I always come back to the French Revolution. In the French Revolution, there was one radical political philosopher, who unfortunately is not recognized enough, and is not even extensively translated. Her works exist for the most part in the French in which she wrote. I am speaking of Olympia de Gouges. She was one of the rare figures of the French Revolution that opposed the beheading of Louis XVI. She imagined a new beginning after the end of the monarchy. She argued that one must deal with the ghosts – rather than getting rid of them, it is necessary to keep them alive, so that you can create a new kind of common sense (*sensus communis)*. I am purposefully using the Kantian term here, not in the way that Kant uses it, but more in the way that it was used later, as some kind of collective memory we share of a particular event, specifically, of that in the event which is unbearable.

<br />

I think that we have to deal with the past in order to create the kind of community that accepts what was unbearable in the past in order to start over. I can no longer believe in the modernist idea of eliminating; but I am for the idea of starting over, the idea of creating a kind of new social agreement about what is unbearable in the past.

## About problems with definitions

**Marianna Michałowska:** I want to return to the question that Akram Zaatari raised earlier: you said that *The Arab Image Foundation* isn’t an archive, but rather, a kind of collection. Does this mean that an artist who works with a selection of archival materials is always creating a collection? My question pertains to the practices of artists working with archives. What is the difference between working with archival material and creating an archive?

<br />

**Wolfgang Ernst:** In such cases, the artist himself hesitates to call his creations archival work. A lot of this fascinating, important work is based on work on memory, or what is called historiography, or counter-history. Maybe we should not over-extend the term “archive” and apply it to all kinds of memory work; call it para-archival, or not even archival at all. Artists don’t like to be forced. There is such as thing as archival science; they have well-defined notions of what an archive is, and according to their criteria, this is not an archive. And you Akram don’t claim it as such, so maybe we shouldn’t mix the terms either.

<br />

**Akram Zaatari:** Yes, thanks. I really think that today, archival practices are provided by companies like Light Impressions, or those who give you acid-free sleeves, or something like that. I don’t like to attach my work to memory, because memory is also a territory of power, and I don’t claim that there is just one memory to remember. I think my work is an organic extension of my documentary work. If you applied documentary techniques to everyday life, taking a documentary outside the documentary genre as it is known in television, that would be my work.

<br />

**Sven Spieker:** Since Wolfgang and I are almost always in agreement, I will maybe offer a mild critique here. On the one hand, I’m all for reserving the term “archive” for the secret state archive, I really am, and saying that not anything else can be an archive. On the other hand, I was very impressed this morning when Wolfgang asked whether we can call digital archives “archives” in the strict sense, and suggested that there really is a need for new terminology.

<br />

As far as contemporary art is concerned, my sense is that perhaps its important, in talking about artists working with archives/collections, to realize that archives are no longer just in production mode. There is also a consumption of the archive: artists quite literally consume them. This consumption is not passive; it’s active, it’s a very creative sort of consumption that can itself be a form of production, as we’ve seen. But the archive as an object to be consumed, for better or for worse – maybe if we look at it in this way, then the idea or the terminology of whether its an archive or collections matters less than the way in which the artist works with it. But I do understand the concern from a strictly academic point of view, and I am much in favor of reserving the term “archive” for a very limited series of administrative procedures, and limiting it to the analogue archive.

<br />

The other thing that came out of the discussion that seems incredibly important to me is that there is also a politics of the archive, very specifically in Eastern Europe, but also in South America. When you attend conferences attended by, let’s say art historians from South America, they will talk at great length about the necessity of great archives staying in their respective countries. They’re very afraid that archives will be sold, say to American university libraries, and so on. So the question of the politics of the archive seems to me to be incredibly important, and the only people who really talk about it at this point are not academics, but artists. It is artists who, whether they mislabel archives as collections or not, try to use archives in a way that makes them politically relevant. And I find that very impressive.

<br />

The last thing I want to say, one last bone of contention: this morning, we seem to have concluded that archives have nothing in common with bodies. This, incidentally, rather contradicts 19th century rhetoric concerning archives, when registries *were* referred to as living bodies, and the archivist was quite literally referred to as someone who intervenes in a defective registry as if it were a living body, the way a surgeon does. But there is also an affective side to the archive. And again, it is often artists who tease out the affective effects from archives that often seem to us to be little more than dead information. What I’m trying to say is that artists, in their claim to archives, and even to the term ‘archive’, can also teach us a lot about archives that we haven’t understood by approaching them in what is perhaps a too strictly academic manner.

<br />

**Ariella Azoulay:** I want to intervene in this discussion about the difference between archive and collection. I understand the distinction that you drew this morning between archive and collection. But when you say, ‘let’s use archive only when we’re speaking about state archive’, what is implied in this claim is a reduction of the state, again, only to the sovereign power, exactly as it was in the 18th century.

<br />

When I think about the state, I would think not only about the sovereign power, but also about the citizens. And – I say it in relation to the archive that I am creating – I insist on the fact that I am creating archives, and nothing else. I am creating an archive, because what I would like to do is to create a new surface of appearance. And in my definition of archive, archives are not defined by the entity that owns them, the state or something else. My definition of archive, which partly comes from Foucault, is his idea of creating a surface of appearance, is that archives define what can be seen through the archive. There are objects that cannot be seen even if we brush them against the grain ten times, that cannot be seen through certain archives.

<br />

So for me, what was essential in the the two archives that I created was not only finding sporadic images here and there in order to narrate history differently, but to create a new grid, a new surface of appearance through which new objects can appear. The the second feature of the archive that is important to me, is that an archive can also be continuously extended, and what it contains can transcend what one person can handle by him or herself. And this is the way that I would like to see archive. Even if I retain the distinction that we should associate them with the State, I don’t want to reduce state to sovereign power.

<br />

**Krzysztof Pijarski:** As you’re stressing that you’re constructing archives, I would be very interested to know how you are constructing them, and what your sources were. Where did you get the pictures that became your archive?

<br />

**Ariella Azoulay:** The two archives are different. The first archive started as an archive of the newspapers that I read, until I realized that I couldn’t add the photographs, because I don’t own the rights. Then I decided to switch strategies, and I visited 60 photographers’ studios. And through these visits, I collected something like a few thousand images, from which I classified only 700. And for this archive I got the rights from the photographers, and this is why I can very easily exhibit this archive all over the world. 

<br />

For the other archive it’s more problematic, because it’s my archive only virtually. 95% of the photographs come from 20 state archives, and I don’t own them, but I own the archive. I insist that I own the virtual archive, which now exists in the form of a book, but which can always be re-exhibited if we pay for another presentation. I own the index, if you like.

<br />

**Wolfgang Ernst:** Just to add to what you said; I agree with what you said, that archive cannot be reduced to the State archive. You produce archives in the Foucauldian sense. If we might only now Now, however, in the year 2011, or after the 20th century, we should include the technological apparatus as well. What used to be the state is now technology itself. Now it is the software programs that produce the way we show images. We use them without really thinking about it, but they are rule governed archives.

<br />

Given that we are concentrating on the photographic archive in this conference, we have to look closely at the specificity of the photographic archive in technology, as opposed to the phonographic and the moving archive, such as sound or video archives. If we talk about archive in a general sense, fine. But I think that one of the ideas of this conference was to find out about the specifics of the photographic archive, which does not move. That’s the active resistance of the photograph, that it does not move like the movie, and does not speak, like a record. This archive is silent and does not move, and this is a fascinating feature of the photographic archive, I think.

## About the emotions and affects of the archive

**Marianna Michałowska:** On the one hand, photographic archives are seen as silent – that would be the Allan Sekula line of thought, when he referred to 19th century traditions of photography, where the image was a silent proof of real fact. On the other hand, in many of the discussions at this conference, people have mentioned the role of emotion. Helen Petrovsky spoke about emotions in Mikhailov’s work, and presenters from institutions involved in archival practices spoke of emotion often, describing situations where archival collections awakened strong emotions in people recognizing themselves in photographs. Through photography, viewers arrive at their own past. Perhaps it is worth discussing this conflict between the anonymity of the archive and the emotions tied to their social functions? Can the two be reconciled?

<br />

**Grażyna Goszczyńska (European Solidarity Centre)**: I would like to tell you all about an exhibit that took place in May of 2009 at the Gdańsk Photography Gallery in the National Museum in Gdańsk. It was organized by Aleksandra Went and Alicja Karska. The exhibit looked like this: the walls of the gallery were covered in empty photo frames, and the entire exhibit, which was strictly photography, was presented on a video screen. It presented the palms of a conservationist of photography, who used various tools to dig through the pictures shown on the screen. The way it was done, it looked as if he was digging through layers.

<br />

At the first moment, when I, as an employee of the Photography Gallery, came into the room, I thought: somebody must have gone crazy, or forgotten to hang the pictures on the wall. When I calmly reflected on the exhibit, I decided that – through completely different means – the authors of the exhibit had accomplished what I have spent 10 years trying to do, working in the Gallery and putting on historical exhibits. Every picture carries an emotional weight, a context, a description; who, what, where, when, because otherwise their appeal to the viewer is purely visual. Imagine looking at one hundred average pictures that you know nothing about. It’s only when you learn what’s on their captions that you start to have an emotional relationship with them. I don’t know, if you all will agree with me, but as a museum employee and a historian, I work on giving photographs an emotional context, because behind every picture is a human destiny, human emotions, often tragedy or the smile of good fortune.

<br />

**Helen Petrovsky:** Could I add something to this topic? I wanted to try to connect what was said about the collections that artists – or the people close to them – produce and what you called emotions, but actually, we have to distinguish between emotion and affect, because they are not the same thing. I’ll try to explain what I mean. You see, when a photographer takes a picture, obviously he’s moved by something, something makes him take the picture, an emotion of sorts. And the same holds true for a collector, because the collector always invests in the items he finds; he’s a detective, he looks for those items, he is impatient to find the right thing. He finds them and assembles then in the “right” way, according to his emotional understanding of the subject.

<br />

But it’s not enough to invest in the collection or to take an emotionally loaded photograph, because it may remain completely unnoticeable. That is to say, it may just be translated to another form of the *studium*, as Barthes puts it, just an image that would remain below the level of recognition and will not become meaningful to spectators as a collective. Now, there may be this moment of transition – it happens with good collectors and good photographers, and I don’t mean good in any sense of supremacy, but rather just that they do the right thing. And by doing the right thing, they happen to translate this initial move, or drive, into what I have called structures of feeling. Structures of feeling belong to no one in particular, but they already form a certain community. It is through these structures of feeling that we define ourselves as spectators, because it is the structure, or structures, that come first, and only then do we become individualized as spectators. That is to say, community precedes individual perception.

<br />

This is definitely connected to the shared experience of a given generation. While it is more about affect, because it is something that comes from without, as for example, pain, it is also a moment of recognition, because this is when we say, “Yes, I know what that image is about,” without actually being able to place where this knowledge is located in the image. Here is an American example: when Cindy Sherman produced her *Untitled Film Stills*, supposedly taken from the 1950s, that was fiction: those films never existed. But what was interesting about the perception that she triggered was the moment of recognition (you can find out more about it in the literature). When the show was first on exhibit, people immediately reacted. They were not art critics, they were ordinary people. They walked in and said, “We know.” What is it that they knew? They recognized their shared historical fantasies about the 1950s, definitely disseminated, or mediated (a more exact formulation), by cinema. So it is a shared horizon that unites spectators even before they as individuals relate to this or that picture. I think that this is an interesting moment in the perception of photography.

## On the creation of objects and the reconfiguration of archives

**John Tagg:** One of the problems connected to the issue of emotion and recognition would certainly be how one marked the distinction between the excess that the archive cannot recode, the excess that is the pain of the unrepresentable, and the recognition that marks the moment of capture by the apparatus. The moment in which we are made subject, the moment in which we become subject of the apparatus of the archive. And, while I agree with so much of what Ariella was saying about turning the archive around, my sense of this conference is that the great pleasure and strength of it was the attempt to think the structure of the archive, what the archive does, while simultaneously trying to think the undoing and the transformation of the archive.

<br />

But undoing the archive is not just a matter of reconfiguring its objects, because the surface of emergence that Ariella has talked about so pertinently, and so poignantly, is the surface of the emergence of the subject. So how does one speak to the subject that is always already captured by the apparatus of the undoing of that? That raises, on the one hand, the problem of the audience, why the book is only published in Italian. Could it find an audience, could it be heard? It also raises the question of the violence of the undoing, something to which we would also have to attend, because we escape one surface of emergence as a subject only to be violated in another way.

<br />

So this is the problem, that pleasure and the recognition could equally be the mark of that which is beyond the coding of the archive, or it could be the mark of that very moment in which we emerge within the archive as the archive’s subject.

<br />

**Ariella Azoulay:** Any archive produces not only what we intend, but also an excess of involuntary effects. Subjectification is one of them: the archive produces subjects. I will formulate it differently: I don’t think that archives necessarily produce subjects. We might disagree on that, but I do agree with you that any archive marks what is not represented in that archive. But this is why I cannot conceive of archive as *one* archive, because I will not conceive the archive under the sovereign idea of the one. This is why I think that archives should be created, as many as possible, in order to undermine the one sovereignty of the state, when we think about the state as a sovereign organ.

<br />

But I do not necessarily agree with the production of the subject. I think that the subject is one of the remnants of the political philosophy of the 18th century, and we are not obliged to continue to think through the political category of the subject. I agree with you that the archive produces us, in a way, but not necessarily that it produces subjects. I think that we can imagine other forms, other entities, and what I would like to imagine is the entity of the citizen, but differently from the way we conceived of it in the 18th century. Earlier, when I presented the two features of the archive, the second one is, of course, related to what you said; the second one which means that the archive always produces more than we can master. 

<br />

**Marianna Michałowska:** Let’s return to the earlier question concerning the reconfiguring of archives. What happens to archives/collections when they are reworked by artists?

<br />

**Krzysztof Pijarski:** Maybe the discussion around <Annotation target="*Kisieland* ">Karol Radziszewski’s project, *Kisieland*, using the private archive of Ryszard Kisiel. Cf. Ch. “The Archive Looking Awry III: *Kisieland* – Queering the Archive.”</Annotation> was actually a good starting point for thinking about the undoing of the archive through its reconfiguration? Because here we have a story about something that is in an archive, but is unacknowledged. What would it mean to acknowledge the stories in those pink files? I’m thinking here of the Institute of National Memory in Poland, where you have a lot of information about Polish citizens, about who they were and what they were doing, information that was put to instrumental and repressive uses over and over again. Could those pink files serve towards a radical reconfiguration of the way we think about the past?

<br />

**Tomasz Basiuk:** I think it’s very hard to know in advance. That is part of what attracted me to Karol’s project, what I referred to as this potential energy, or release of energy that might come from exposure, in this case exposure in the sense of bringing something into the public eye. But I think that the promise, challenge, and interest inherent in that is its singularity, that no one knows what will actually emerge from that kind of exposure. It is difficult to know what will happen when those files are opened – because that moment will come – and I think it depends very much on when it will happen and what kind of use will be made of them. That does speak, in a sense, to the relationship between archives and the making of subjects, in that, if those files were opened today, some people would have their subjectivity radically reconfigured, for better or for worse. It’s not all good, certainly, I think it’s also a very dangerous thing. And I think that danger is part of what is so clear to me in Ryszard Kisiel’s photographs.

<br />

**Karolina Lewandowska:** I would like to refer to this claim that archives should be constantly created. I would add that I think they should also be constantly re-created, that it’s very important that archives, even state archives – which are enormous, and tend to be very static – should be in motion. This is a way to make this power of the archive less powerful. It is important that we create many different archives; that the state has its own role but that private archives are also created, and that the owners of archives change, because each owner contributes something new. Of course, something is also always lost when the owner changes.

<br />

Another issue entirely is that the agents of this re-creation are not archivists, but artists, or people in other disciplines. What archivists do is a basic thing and a necessary one; nobody would undermine it. But it is also very important that people from other disciplines come to archives and undermine their present state, make a mess of them so to say. During these meetings we could look through artistic projects and strategies used by different institutions. I think it shows that this line of thought should be developed.

<br />

**Marianna Michałowska:** I think what Karolina said is especially important to the discussion of the (neg)entropic power that is contained in the archive. We have these two immanent powers in the archive, which we could call life and death. But of course it is essential that this negentropic energy be stronger than the entropic one – don’t you agree?

<br />

**Wolfgang Ernst:** Sigmund Freud actually used this notion of entropy when he discussed the death drive. Vilem Flusser, the media philosopher, took this notion and – like the Russian semioticians, Lotman and others – said that culture as such is a negentropic effort against the dissolution of things. We are part of it now, actually. So, in a very generalized sense, archival (neg)entropy is culturally very poetic indeed.

<br />

**Marianna Michałowska:** I would like to ask you a question that is maybe a bit controversial, given the presence of so many institutions that specialize in archives. I would like to recall a theory from the late 1980s about musealisation, developed by Hermann Lübbe. He didn’t discuss archives so much as museums, but he wrote that we are in a state of musealisation, and the more museums we create, the more past we produce. So do you think, all of you who specialize in archives, that we are producing a past? Do you agree with this old theory about the musealisation of everyday life?

<br />

**Wolfgang Ernst:** I was a bit afraid; after two days of fascinating projects on memory in Poland and Slovakia, and industrial photography, of this obsession with memory and the past. I’m not of the active ’68 generation, but suddenly, a bit of anarchy is a refreshing impulse – I was missing it. It’s a bit uncanny, how we much we now indulge in reworking memory, and the archival turn, and the archival project in art. As a political being, I’m slightly frightened by that.

<br />

**Sven Spieker:** I have to say that to me Lübbe’s thesis seems old postmodernism to me. And I did not experience this conference in that way necessarily; on the contrary, it seems to me that what I referred to before as the consumption of the archive is in a sense the admission that archives don’t just tell us about the past, they can also tell us something about the present. I don’t know about the future, but definitely something about the present. The way in which artists work with archives has a lot to do with the present, and that is why they don’t care about this distinction between archives and collections. Let’s face it – they call it whatever they want.

<br />

Talking about artists, what is fascinating to me is – and incidentally, it is not only artists who talk about archives in this way – how archival work might allow to look at history ironically – not as a closed shop, but as something that still has potential for opening, and perhaps for alternatives. Maybe that could mean that an archive could even give you opportunities of figuring out alternatives that extend into the future. Now, obviously from an archivist’s point of view that is a completely ridiculous position, but so are many other things that we have said in the last two days. But it does give you a sense that there is a very active way that archives are being worked with/consumed by artists today, and that can mean that archives will be turned from being administrative archives to collections, or back.

It also shows that the approach that artists take to documentary material today is not about memory. At the best of times, it is about politics, and about the fact that you come from a region of the world in which archives are anything but dead, documents are anything but a reflection of the dead past. Rather, they have a very powerful and often painful bearing on the present. I think the reason archives are being worked with by artists today has everything to do with the present, and much less to do with nostalgia – that’s postmodernism. We’ve been there.

<br />

**Andre Gunthert:** Yes, I completely agree. I think the idea of the museum is an interesting one, because the museum not only deals with the past, but with a kind of present. At the beginning of the 18th century, when the first great public museum opened, the aim – not only of the museum of art, but also museums of science, the British Library, the very powerful democratic idea of the museum in general – was simply to say that what was private would be made accessible to more people than before.

<br />

The reason we are now using the word archive is linked to the technological turn, the digital revolution, which was followed by the rebirth of the old utopian dream of the Alexandrian library, the library that would contain all the knowledge in the world. From the very beginning, in the 1970s, there was already this idea that digital tools would give broader access to content that was not accessible before. So perhaps the reason we use the term archive is because we feel that the word signifies the common, public dimension of contents.

<br />

As Wolfgang said earlier today, the “archive” was formerly something secret, that was the natural dimension of the archive. But we don’t use this term in the sense of something secret or inaccessible, anymore; on the contrary, we use “archive” to signify its public character, as opposed to a collection, which could be something private. Archive, in the aftermath of the digital revolution, means something accessible.

<br />

Now the question is, what about images? In very broad terms, images as objects were always related to property; they were something private. Much more than text, for instance. The fact that even on a juridical level, on the level of right, you can quote a text, means that you can appropriate it and make it your own thing, use it again. That was never possible with the image before digitization. So the new status of images within the digital world is to become public content. That is new for images, not for other content. The new idea of the Alexandrian library of images, which was never possible before – when we thought of the Alexandrian library before, we thought of text, and books, because it was simply not possible to dream of a common archive of images – I don’t say that it’s possible now, because technologically it is very intricate, but this dream exists today, and couldn’t exist before.

<br />

The idea of this new accessibility of images is now in the center of their usage. Something like Google Images was totally unthinkable 15 years ago. Google Images brings something totally new: it brings this open access, or what seems to be open access, because like in any museum, these images are chosen by someone. But for the user, it is better to have access to content than not – it is better to have museums than not. And that is true of Google, or any big industry – of course they have power. But users do something else with their contents.

<br />

**Roman Babiak:** Maybe just a comment to add to your question of why isn’t there more anarchy in the archive. I believe that in Central and Eastern Europe, institutions don’t have the human and economical power to reshape and reconstruct the archive, so basically artists are taking over. But the weight of those archives, which were never before researched, is so heavy that perhaps it crushes all possibilities of punk and anarchy, and makes those projects very serious and very political.

<br />

You were saying there should be another name for digital archives – I believe that commercial institutions used the term “image banks,” which also had an economical connotation. So I don’t think there should be a new word for “digital archive,” because I don’t see a big difference between “image bank” and “digital archive.”

<br />

**Ariella Azoulay:** I just wanted to add two short comments in relation to what André just said. The first; it’s true that Google Images allow us to access a large amount of images that we never could have accessed earlier. But unfortunately, we have private access. We can rarely share it, because once you want to publish it and share it with others, you have to pay such a large amount of money to buy the right for these images that it’s impossible. Just recently I was writing about the revolution in Egypt, and I’m now unable to publish my paper, because it’s based on 40 images, and it would cost a fortune to buy the rights and share them with the public. Google Images is a wonderful tool for academics to share images with their students in class, for instance, because you don’t infringe on copyright in doing so, but if you want to share them with a broader public, it becomes more complicated.

<br />

In relation to Google and to the discussion you had this morning, John, about the *Commons*, there is a very amazing website called Schmoogle. The idea of Schmoogle – and I recommend the site to all of you – is that if you try the same entry you’d use with Google, it “steals” the entries from Google and gives them randomly, without the indexication of Google. It’s a way to overcome the indexication and the censorship of Google.

<br />

**Didier Schulmann**: I would also like to add some words to what André said, because I am a museum curator, and I am lost in the world of the archive and the library. Previously, the idea of collection was the idea of something open, a public collection for all citizens. And now, especially in contemporary art museums, the collection has become gigantic, with installations that can only exist if you can experience them. You can’t image what, say, one of Boltanski’s installations is like if you only see them on a screen. So the idea of collection is more and more private, even in public museums. For curators, it means that they display less and less of the artworks they have in storage. Instead of that, the idea of archive, which was completely secret, inaccessible, is exactly the contrary. It’s a huge evolution, even in the common sensibility of the public. These two days of discussion about the idea of archive, ten years ago, would have been about the idea of the collection.

<br />

**André Gunthert:** If I may, an answer to both of your comments. The question of access and the question of right are the same thing. Of course, all these constructions are paradoxical, and we never get neither free access nor full rights, especially to images. But the fact is that there is a new dynamic that is moving in that direction. For instance, you said that Google gives us the index, but not the images, which is true. But first of all, Google doesn’t have the rights to do what it does. In terms of copyright, what Google Images does is forbidden – they’ve taken the rights, they don’t wait to receive them. The use overcomes the rights. And then, on the side of use, a new thing is to connect Facebook to Google, because on Facebook you can share any content you want. And on my Facebook, I see plenty of shared content from Google Images. On the juridical level, it’s a perfect system, because you cannot go against the idea of Facebook, the friend group. The friend group is a very powerful weapon against copyright. Use always tends in the same direction, which is to get access and to give users appropriation, because the question of property or access is that when you can do something with content, then it can be used.

<br />

**Ella Chmielewska:** I think I heard a call for the artistic disturbance of archives. Perhaps there is also a value in a kind of forensic attitude, because the moment we enter a body, we disturb it. And we could reflect on what kinds of disturbances we are creating: sometimes the things we do not recognize actually matter. And sometimes the things we do not recognize as mattering, when we look closer, become important to a specific thing, even the most important. And sometimes when we are talking about images – as somebody who both takes photographs and works with historical photographs – we do not know what captures us in the image before we take it. We do not necessarily recognize it yet, though we may have an inkling. We take a picture because there is something there which we do not know, and it’s the same with a discovery in the archive; there was something wondrous, or curious there. We recognize an anticipation of recognition rather than something that maps onto Raymond Williams’ structures of feeling or some kind of communal remembering. So it may be, I think, that there is value in paying attention to those things that we do not expect to find, and to our own actions in the archive.

<br />

**Marianna Michałowska:** This short comment brings us back to the “human” side of archives. Even utilizing search engines, we still want to preserve the rights of human choice. Archives are a source of important and fascinating experiences, rational experiences, but also unconscious ones.

<br />

Thank you for this interesting discussion; I hope it will survive not only in publication, and both digital and printed archives, but also as an impulse for the further archeology of photography.
