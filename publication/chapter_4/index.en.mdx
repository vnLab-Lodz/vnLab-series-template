# Matter and Memory in Photography

<Author link="/chapter_22">Helen Petrovsky</Author>

The experience of recent history that united East and West in a tight, however forced, embrace, and the traces it has left behind, prompt us, survivors of that time who still happen to remember, to reconsider the traditional conception of the archive. There are so many images of the period in question that have become iconic, yet there is a much greater array of those that remain blurred, fragmented, and incomplete; in a word, wholly insignificant. Will they ever be elevated to the status of an archival document? Do they deserve becoming part of an archive at all? It is these issues that I will be addressing by turning to a photographic series which, on the one hand, is well embedded in historical time, while on the other, implicitly calls for a reinterpretation of historicity itself.

<br />

Before turning to _Yesterday’s Sandwich_, a series by the famous photographer Boris Mikhailov, let me briefly explain in what way artistic production may be more telling and “truer to life” than the visual evidence that is generically seen as documentary. Indeed, in terms of genre, Mikhailov is far from being a documentary photographer – the scenes he depicts are often overtly enacted, his models pose for him on a contractual basis, and he is a formalist in that he returns to a whole set of devices such as the use of color or the superimposition of shots. Yet I am deeply convinced that his rendering of the Soviet and post-Soviet experience is one of the greatest documents of this historical period. What I have in mind is not the well-known premise that artists tend to intuitively or subconsciously grasp the spirit of their time, and that by properly reading their texts, that is, deciphering them on semantic and symbolic levels, we will be able to uncover some higher impersonal truth. I have already twice used the word “experience” in this paper, and I think it is a key to understanding Mikhailov’s project as a whole. He is a documentary photographer precisely inasmuch as he succeeds in giving expression to what remains essentially unrepresentable.

<br />

Here we are confronted with a real paradox. Aren’t we always looking for the tangible traces of the past? And isn’t the archive (to be more exact, the various existing archives) packed with such irrefutable evidence? My contention is that photographers such as Boris Mikhailov, first, draw heavily on the invisible, namely, a shared historical experience that forms both the condition and the ultimate horizon of their work, and, second, that in doing so they challenge the state of the archive, which has everything to do with historical memory and ways in which it is preserved and passed on to the future generations.

_Yesterday’s Sandwich_ is a series of photographic superimpositions dating from as early as the 1960s. The artist insists that a “purposeful search for the arbitrary,” which is at the heart of his method, is to some extent an anticipation of Sots <Annotation target="Art.">Boris Mikhailov, _Yesterday’s Sandwich_ (London: Phaidon Press, 2006), 2.</Annotation> Indeed, there is a lot of irony in Mikhailov’s works, and quite often it addresses the social environment. Mikhailov’s conceptual approach to art may be also discerned in his specific use of color: he clearly privileges red, ranging from a sign of statehood to color _per se_, when the relationship it enters into with its double-layered ground becomes entirely formal. However, even if the traces of Sots Art are practically indisputable (and the task that art historians are faced with is to read these works in terms of origins), now that several decades have elapsed since that time, viewers who are out of touch with recent Soviet history find it hard to understand how and why artists combined elements of ideological language to express their critical positions. To put it another way, Sots Art as a movement and project calls for systematic reconstruction.

<br />

However, besides this historical documentary content, _Yesterday’s Sandwich_, in my view, has another potential that is again related to the document, but only insofar as it is freed of its usual archival implications. The artist Ilya Kabakov once defined Mikhailov’s photographs as <Annotation target="“total.”">Victor Tupitsyn, “Ilya Kabakov: Tomatoes in Berdyansk,” in _Verbal Photography: Ilya Kabakov, Boris Mikhailov, and The Moscow Archive of New Art_, [Texts by] M. Tupitsyn, V. Tupitsyn (Museu Serralves, 2004), 177.</Annotation> This should not be understood in the sense that they aspire to completeness or that each of them lays claim to an artistic status for itself. Boris Mikhailov has always worked with the raw material of life, whose “artistic” value is by definition low or altogether worthless. It is not that the life he depicted was unspectacular, that is, eventless, gray and dreary. Mikhailov has always uncovered a different dimension in life, one that we are still able to relate to today despite the dramatic change of historical context. Therefore, describing Mikhailov’s pictures as “total,” Kabakov was referring to a “penetrating direct hit,” to that by means of which they functioned, to quote him one again, like <Annotation target="“shrapnel.”">Ibid.</Annotation> At the same time no separate element was highlighted in the pictures, whether detail, character, concrete image or perspective.

<br />

I would like to depart from the idea of a “total photograph” (whose intersection with Kabakov’s own “total installation” is quite obvious) in order to suggest that _Superimpositions_, another name for _Yesterday’s Sandwich_, might be regarded as _memory-images_. At this point it is appropriate to briefly recall the interpretation of memory-images made by Henri Bergson, one of the most radical thinkers of the 20th century. It is well known that, together with Freud and Proust, Bergson lays the ground for the understanding of involuntary memory, although the term itself belongs to Proust. In Bergson we come across two distinct forms of memory. The one boils down to motor mechanisms that enable us to adapt to the present situation; it is dependent on our will and “acts our past <Annotation target="experience”">Henri Bergson, _Matter and Memory_, trans. N.M. Paul and W.S. Palmer (New York: Zone Books, 1991), 151.</Annotation> without, however, calling up its image. In fact, it is not so much memory, properly speaking, as habit. Determined by nature, it reflects the biological need of our body to correspond to its environment.

<br />

The other is “the true <Annotation target="memory,”">Ibid.</Annotation> coextensive with consciousness and, unlike the first, moving wholly in the past. It consists of memory-images that picture “all past events with their outline, their color and their place in <Annotation target="time.”">Ibid., 88.</Annotation> This memory is “entirely spontaneous,” being “as capricious in reproducing as it is faithful in <Annotation target="preserving.”">Ibid.</Annotation> It serves neither utility nor practical application, but in storing up images follows a necessity dictated by a nature of its own. If the first form of memory is based on repetition, the second is oriented towards imagination: whatever has been translated into a memory-image remains essentially unrepeatable, that is, unique. The two forms of memory, according to Bergson, are connected through the human body which, itself an image, is “a section of the universal <Annotation target="becoming,”">Ibid., 151.</Annotation> in other words, the place of passage of the movements that are both received and thrown back and are known to us as “sensori-motor phenomena”. Thus, memory expressed in images, the one that is also defined as “virtual” or <Annotation target="“pure,”">Ibid., 127.</Annotation> can only be actualized – materialized – in the present moment of perception.

<br />

Before returning to _Yesterday’s Sandwich_, let me enumerate the qualities of the memory-image according to Bergson. Memory-images are fugitive; no wonder Bergson compares them to dream-images that appear and disappear independently of our will. Spontaneous by their very nature, memory-images “flash out at <Annotation target="intervals”">Ibid., 87.</Annotation>, only to be inhibited and ousted by the slightest movement of the voluntary memory. If we recollect the dream-image in Freud, it emerges in a state of psychic passivity, or literally in an absent state of mind, and is nothing other than a diagram or outline of the figures that appear in dreams <Annotation target="themselves.">See: Sigmund Freud. “The Interpretation of Dreams,” in _The Standard Edition of the Complete Psychological Works of Sigmund Freud_, trans. under the general editorship of J. Strachey, in collaboration with A. Freud, assisted by A. Strachey and A. Tyson (London: The Hogarth Press and the Institute of Psycho-Analysis, 1953), vol. IV, esp. chapter I (e), (c).</Annotation> In other words, dream-images rise to the surface of consciousness when the latter is emptied and flattened out, that is, when the subject loses all control of its mental operations and representations. Bergson further observes that despite their evanescence, memory-images are complete, which is perhaps best proven by the faculty of mental photography that is to all appearances subconscious. The memory-image is “perfect from the <Annotation target="outset;”">Henri Bergson, op. cit., 83.</Annotation> if darkened, in other words, repressed, as we would say today, the image tends to reemerge, if only in a state of sleep. Finally, Bergson does not overlook the fact the memory-images are affective: their “affective <Annotation target="coloring,”">Ibid., 106.</Annotation> as he puts it, only adds to the immediate completeness of the image.

<br />

I will now try to relate these thoughts to photography. As I have said, Mikhailov’s pictures function like memory-images. But what kind of memory do they refer to and what exactly do they bring into view? The memory in question has an unusual mode of existence. It is not based on the certitude of facts, although it may well integrate them. This memory is essentially affective – it is inseparable from the emotional tone of those upon whom it descends. This is not a mere figure of speech, as the memory I am discussing belongs to no one in particular. Rather, it is an image that comes from without and yet is perfectly recognizable. Recognized images are total – they contain no gaps or ruptures; they seize us in the manner that was once so well described by Proust. I think it has already become clear that such memory-images are a priori collective, and perhaps Walter Benjamin was the first to point to the connection between involuntary memory, experience and the material of a collective <Annotation target="past.">See: Walter Benjamin, “On Some Motifs in Baudelaire,” in id., _Illuminations. Essays and Reflections_, ed. and with an Intro. by H. Arendt, trans. H. Zohn (New York: Schocken Books, 1968), 159.</Annotation>

Involuntary memory is the language of experience itself. Benjamin distinguishes _Erfahrung_ from _Erlebnis_, that is, experience in the proper sense from an incident turned into “a moment that has been <Annotation target="lived.”">Ibid., 163.</Annotation> Experience breaks the shield of consciousness and, without having entered the realm of awareness, that is, without having been tied to a “certain hour in one’s <Annotation target="life,”">Ibid.</Annotation> is stored in the form of unconscious memory traces. For Freud it would be equal to trauma, which necessarily comes back (and is hopefully acted out) by way of symptoms and/or distorted images. On the other hand, what is experienced explicitly or consciously tends to be forgotten in the long run. Such, in fact, is the ethos of the archive. But experience, as I have said, remains essentially unrepresentable. It can be retrieved only tangentially, to the extent to which a visible image triggers recognition. And as spectators we may be able to recognize what we have never seen or known.

<br />

There is nothing mystical about it. Our experience of history by and large is mediated by images and simulacra, while history itself remains forever out of <Annotation target="reach.">See, for example: Fredric Jameson, _Postmodernism, or, The Cultural Logic of Late Capitalism_ (London, New York: Verso, 1991), 1–54.</Annotation> Mikhailov’s photographs awaken and legitimate our own historical fantasies, only it should be understood that the imaginary is itself a shared experience of the historical. For various reasons we, a fantasizing or imagining collective, are denied direct access even to the most recent historical events. Moreover, there are histories that are not reduced to narratives or mere chronological sequences of dates and events. In this case we are dealing with the experience of history as it is lived by such unstable entities as generations. Therefore, we recognize the past, not as a form of positive knowledge, but rather as something that persists in its formless existence, haunting our memory precisely _because_ it is omitted from it.

<br />

This brings us back to _Yesterday’s Sandwich_ and to the present time of perception. In many of the photographs it is the texture that seems to come to the foreground – coarseness of the walls, dry cracked soil (or maybe crumpled paper), a naked body sliced into rhombi by a hammock, clumsy, semi-childish scribble or simply graininess occasionally thickening into a cloud. Memories are as tactile as they are visual, and so their “truth” may be uncovered at this level of the signifier. Thus _Superimpositions_ show as much as they conceal: they uncover the workings of memory, but they do not at all try to represent them. One can hardly learn something from these pictures – as documents they are subjective and therefore unreliable. Yet they tell us a lot precisely by displaying no pretension whatsoever: every person has his/her own experience of the arbitrary, and it is out of arbitrary images – echoes of real events and sensations – that an ego is eventually composed. Here, however, the images pertain to a historically transient collective.

<br />

Unlike Sots Art – an ironic juxtaposition of the official and what might be called private buffoonery – memory-images retain both of these dimensions at once. In them “the ideological” is dissolved in the everyday in which there are always zones of freedom. Irony in this case is not a consciously chosen device, but the effect of existence itself, that incessantly resists visual and discursive appropriation. I think it is significant but also very much predictable that *Yesterday’s Sandwich* attracts viewers today, when the rejection of the Soviet past gives way to its estranged and tranquil contemplation.

<br />

I would like to stress that memory-images are in no way retrospective. Their time is not fulfilled, and they cannot be wholly relegated to the past. These invisible images are specters haunting the <Annotation target="present">For a conceptualization of the specter see the late works of Jacques Derrida, for example: Jacques Derrida and Bernard Stiegler, _Echographies of Television. Filmed Interviews_, trans. J. Bajorek (Cambridge: Polity Press, 2002).</Annotation> – points of rupture within the present itself. Memories are precisely cracks in the present: they disrupt the continuity of time, including that of history. Far from being a fact of the past, Mikhailov’s _Sandwich_, in my view, is more of a commentary on the present. The photos in the series often border on absurdity, however, it is not an objective mark of the time (as Sots Art would have it), but a feature of the memory in question: memory-images are useless, no doubt, but in addition they are utterly senseless. Numerous haphazard details are woven into a spectral fabric that gnaws at the present itself.

<br />

It would be no exaggeration to say that all of Mikhailov’s photos are about time and a collective existence in time. As I have shown elsewhere, what they manage to display without making a representation of it, is the affect of Soviet time <Annotation target="itself.">See my essay “Lost in Time: Boris Mikhailov and His Study of the Soviet,” in _Ruins of Modernity_, ed. J. Hell and A. Schönle (Durham & London: Duke UP, 2010), 439–457.</Annotation> What is at issue is a shared historical experience. However, it is not translated into _signs_ of the Soviet, that is, all those ethnographic or cultural details that abound in Mikhailov’s pictures and, I hasten to add, that are so valued by the archive. To put it differently, experience is at odds with semiotics, as well as language in a broader sense. But what is the place of experience and/or affect in visual representation? We are so trustful of visual data that it becomes difficult to conceptualize the very conditions under which images penetrate into the realm of visibility. In the concluding section of my paper I will treat this issue by turning to Walter Benjamin and his concept of the dialectical image.

<br />

Benjamin conceives of the dialectical image in terms of a constellation of the past and the present. However, “it isn’t that the past casts its light on what is present or that what is present casts its light on what is past; rather, an image is that in which the Then and the Now come together, in a flash of lightning, into a <Annotation target="constellation.”">Cited in: Eduardo Cadava, _Words of Light. Theses on the Photography of History_ (Princeton, NJ: Princeton UP, 1997), 64.</Annotation> Benjamin’s constellation has a temporality that is distinct from the “homogeneous, empty <Annotation target="time”">Walter Benjamin, “Theses on the Philosophy of History,” in id., _Illuminations_, 261.</Annotation> of history. It is what he calls _Jetztzeit_, or “the now” (also translated as <Annotation target="“now-time”).">Ibid.</Annotation> It should hardly come as a surprise that this time is associated with the Messianic, namely, a Messianic “cessation of happening,” but likewise a “caesura in the movement of <Annotation target="thought.”">Ibid., 263; Eduardo Cadava, op. cit., 61.</Annotation> We are therefore dealing with a double interruption or arrest: the dropping out of historical time and the suspension of thinking itself.

<ViewportImage

This new temporality, which is closely linked to Benjamin’s method, namely “dialectics at the standstill,” accounts for ways in which a historical object is constructed. Indeed, the latter should be “blasted” out of the continuum of history. Being essentially a <Annotation target="“monad,”">Walter Benjamin, “Theses on the Philosophy of History,” 263.</Annotation> it retains “on a reduced <Annotation target="scale”">Cited in: Susan Buck-Morss, *The Dialectics of Seeing: Walter Benjamin and the Arcades Project* (Cambridge, Mass. / London: The MIT Press, 1989), 219.</Annotation> all the forces and interests that are at play in history. But the historical object is precisely the dialectical image, the positioning of which, Benjamin insists, “is in no way <Annotation target="arbitrary.”">Ibid.</Annotation> It turns out that images lend themselves to meaningful interpretation only at specific moments. For Benjamin those are moments of danger or crisis (as was, perhaps, the case with his own *Theses on the Philosophy of History* (1940) that can be read as an attempt at affirming the possibility of revolutionary change in a time of utter hopelessness). And it is the task of the “historical materialist” (in the broader sense of a critical observer) to “seize hold of a memory as it flashes up at a moment of <Annotation target="danger.”">Walter Benjamin, “Theses on the Philosophy of History,” 255.</Annotation> But this is also a critical point in the movement of images themselves, or, in Benjamin’s words, their “coming to <Annotation target="legibility.”">Cited in: Eduardo Cadava., op. cit., 64.</Annotation> The past is to be “held fast,” then, in “the now of recognition [*im Jetzt der Erkennbarkeit*] <Annotation target=".”">Cited in: Susan Buck-Morss, op. cit., 219.</Annotation>

<br />

How can we make use of this rather complicated scheme for our own purposes? First of all, I would like to point to a certain kinship between photography, as I see it, and the dialectical image. The cognitive aspect of the dialectical image seems to be quite obvious: it is a method allowing for a reading of historical events, especially those that have been passed on in silence (the task of the historical materialist, argues Benjamin, is to “brush history against the <Annotation target="grain”">Walter Benjamin, “Theses on the Philosophy of History,” 257.</Annotation>). At the same time a dialectical image is always necessarily material: it rises out of an object, work of art, text, document or memory. The same holds true for the photograph. On the one hand, it is a visual representation distinct from other kinds of representation such as cinema or painting. But on the other, it is itself a temporal structure or, in the words of Barthes, a “new space-time <Annotation target="category,”">Roland Barthes, “Rhetoric of the Image.” in _Classic Essays on Photography_, ed. A. Trachtenberg (New Haven, Conn.: Leete’s Island Books, 1980), 278.</Annotation> since the presence it captures, although absolute, is always already <Annotation target="deferred.">See: Roland Barthes, _Camera Lucida. Reflections on Photography_, trans. R. Howard (London: Flamingo (Fontana Paperbacks), 1981 (1984)), 77.</Annotation> To put it differently, there is something in the photograph (and about it) that does not belong to the order of representation: a caesura of sorts.

<br />

However, it is not only a discontinuity between representation and the represented that the photograph’s temporality implies. It is also that which has to be “read into” the photographic image so that it would become truly meaningful or documentary. Alluding to an “unspoken government presence” and “fabricated ideals” in the pictures made in the USSR and the US during the 1930s, Philip Brookman has shrewdly remarked: “Today we must reference the inauthentic nature of the documentary image in order to seek its <Annotation target="authenticity.”">Philip Brookman, “Afterword,” in Leah Bendavid-Val, _Propaganda and Dreams. Photographing the 1930s in the USSR and the US_ (Zurich, New York: Edition Stemmle, 1999), 212–213.</Annotation> This is absolutely true. I would slightly reformulate this thought by saying: today we must reference. In other words, our perception of the documentary image is accurate to the extent to which we embrace the historical conditions that allow for its initial legibility. Such conditions, however, are not some unattainable abstraction, but rather those “structures of <Annotation target="feeling”">See: Raymond Williams, _Marxism and Literature_ (Oxford, New York: Oxford UP, 1977), 128–135.</Annotation> that had made the pictures recognizable to their contemporaries in the first place. Today this invisible dimension is activated by our own perception (which itself is “inauthentic,” to be sure). However, “must” as applied to reference means that the time, if not exactly critical, is ripe for the flash of recognition on our part.

<br />

By way of conclusion I would like to return to the questions that were posed at the beginning of this paper. I think that photos such as Mikhailov’s _Yesterday’s Sandwich_ challenge our understanding of the archive. They depict historical events whose symbolic status remains open, to say the very least. These events have to do with a shared emotional experience and/or the dream images that express unconscious collective aspirations and desires. It is an almost impossible task to find a place for them in the visible image, as they remain suspended between language and history. Yet if my assumption is correct, then Mikhailov’s photographs teach us the following lesson: “History decomposes into images, not into <Annotation target="narratives.”">Cited in: Susan Buck-Morss, op. cit., 220.</Annotation> Such was Walter Benjamin’s materialist approach to history. It is at this point, I will add, that photography is at one with the dialectical image.
