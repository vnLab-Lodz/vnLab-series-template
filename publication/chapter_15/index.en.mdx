# The Practice of Digital Archives: Will Digital Archives be Open?

<Author>Nikodem Boƒcza-Tomaszewski</Author>

We have already discussed many aspects of archiving at this conference, including many problems currently related to it. I would like to approach this question in a very broad way, presenting the approach that many of my co-workers and I take in our work at the National Digital Archive (Narodowe Archiwum Cyfrowe). We at the NAC are involved in archiving on a number of levels: we are a digital archive (digitalizing analogue materials, as well as archiving the Internet and electronic documents), we also have an archive of photographs, which contains over 15 million pictures, and finally, we are an audio-visual archive, owning, among other things, the archives of Polish Radio and Polish Television up to 1993. Thus, we are a crossroad for all current trends in archival practices, and our goal is to find a common system of classification for all of the materials bestowed upon us. We don’t treat our collections as three separate realms – we are not three archives in one. Quite the opposite: we strive to unite these disparate parts and form a common perspective, which not only benefits us, the curators, but also our users, who demand a simple and uniform way of accessing our collections.

<br />

Thinking back on the early years of digital archiving, we may recall that they were characterized by the spontaneous development of computerisation, without a corresponding concern for archiving. The greatest anxiety of the pioneers of digital archiving was a vision of the digital “dark ages”; a fear that all data from the early days of digitalisation would be completely lost. This fear grew primarily in the 1990s, and the “philosophy” that was meant to remedy it spawned, among other things, the UNESCO Charter on the Preservation of Digital <Annotation target="Heritage.">The Charter on the Preservation of Digital Heritage was adopted in the 32nd session of the General Conference of UNESCO in 2003 (resolution nr 42, October 15, 2003). (All footnotes are by the editors.)</Annotation> It was believed that the most important task of an institution dealing with collective memory was to preserve digital heritage, which keeps amassing at a furious pace and, despite being completely unregulated, is of great value for the future.

<br />

The first decade of the 21st century showed, however, that digital archives do not pose the problems they were expected to 20 years ago. They do occasionally demand feats of technological archaeology – particularly when dealing with old diskettes, obsolete formats, or material recorded on peculiar kinds of media (this pertains to audiovisual media in particular), but these are not insoluble problems. We are capable of overcoming them, and thus, in my opinion, the threat of the digital dark ages is now a historical relic.

<br />

Currently, we can distinguish three elementary fields of digital archiving. The first is the archiving of public information. I am not only thinking of “electronic documents” or electronic forms for filing taxes <Annotation target="on-line">In Poland this way of filing taxes was accessible from Aug 16th 2006 to large enterprises, and from Jan 1st 2008 to small businesses. Since Apr 1st 2008 this right was also extended to natural persons.</Annotation> (we are not responsible for the archiving of the latter in any case), but also about web pages of public institutions or, broadly speaking, the Internet activities of these institutions. The second field encompasses information collected by all currently functioning computer systems; registration systems recording objects, property, and shifts in population (as is clear, such information is generally – though not always – taken from the public sphere). This group also contains information about telecommunications, which – though we ourselves may pay much attention to them – are currently collected in vast amounts by operators of cell phone or telecommunications networks (the cumulative information pertains above all to the network traffic, or the activities of users). There is, moreover, data from surveillance systems (which are particularly tied to increasingly urgent questions such as: how and in what contexts is it acceptable to monitor various aspects of social existence?). There is, finally, a third realm of archiving, not only the largest, in terms of the amount of data stored in it, but also in some sense the one of the highest quality, because it is the best indicator of the actual practice of everyday life. This is the collection of what could be called “community” information, more generally, all the information that is to be found on the part of the Internet known as Web 2.0 – content that appeared in the second phase of the Internet’s development, when users could upload most of what is now the current “content” on the World Wide Web. From the perspective of the archivist, these are enormous digital repositories. For example, portals such as Facebook or the Polish site Nasza Klasa are collections of billions of photographs, pieces of textual information, and other forms of content generated by users on a daily basis.

<br />

In archival practice relating to these three fields, the current approach is to archive everything. A good example of a public institute that embodies this belief is the <Annotation target="INA">The Institut National de l’Audiovisuel was founded in 1974, and is location in Bry-sur-Marne in Paris. It contains the archives of French radio and public television.</Annotation>, which archives everything emitted on French television and radio, including commercials. Analogously, the Internet <Annotation target="Archive">The Internet Archive was created as a non-proft in 1996. As of 2009 it is located in San Francisco, California.</Annotation> strives to preserve everything that appears on the Internet. Technological limitations actually serve as a contributing factor to this trend: it’s far easier to archive on a massive scale, directing robots to search the entire domain of the web, than it is to implement the selective methods of traditional archivists, who determine what is actually valuable and worth preserving for the future.

<br />

Consequently, we are currently building numerous repositories or – considered from a global perspective – gigantic archives, which have an absolute memory, storing everything that has ever been posted on the World Wide Web. In this context, we can differentiate between two basic modes of behavior. One option is to accumulate as much information as possible, regardless of whether it is necessary or not. That is how it works in the case of telecommunications operators collecting information – no one knows why the operators want this data, but they are collected nonetheless. On the other hand, however, we must draw attention to the limited access to digital archives. This applies to corporations, who harvest their collected material or analyze it from the perspective of potential marketing value, as well as to public institutions, who prefer to work behind the scenes, without unnecessary public scrutiny.

<br />

Thus, in my opinion, a serious challenge we will face in the future, certainly in the next decade, is to answer the question: how shall we go about creating open archives? Up to now, we have succeeded in solving many technical problems associated with the creation of digital archives. We no longer live in fear of the loss or sudden disappearance of data. We have many well functioning mechanisms of archiving at our disposal (Google undoubtedly remains the leader in this field, but the competition is hot on its heels). Given that we have begun to document everything, we must now consider how to make that information available, and how this system will function in practice. This raises two basic questions: what should we archive, and how can we guarantee open access to it?

<br />

In regards to the first question, we must ask ourselves several practical, more detailed questions. I don’t want to offer answers, but would like to point out a few problems stemming from the notion of digital archives as open archives. This brings us back to the aforementioned problem of telecommunication companies archiving location tracking data, raising doubts as to whether it might not be better to authorize the destruction of data in computer systems, based on the model of the “lapse of the sentence”. According to Polish law, if someone serves time in prison, ten years after their release all information about their conviction is erased from official registers, indicating that the state has forgiven their <Annotation target="crime">See Penal Code of 6.06.1997 (Dz. U. Nr 88, poz. 553, art. 107, § 1).</Annotation>. Such a system is impossible on the Internet, as evidenced by the case of a Spanish doctor who, wanting to combat an archived unfavorable opinion of him, had to file a case against the Google search <Annotation target="engine.">In 1991 *El Pais* published the story of a patient who accused Hugo Guidotti Russo, a plastic surgeon, of performing an unsuccessful breast operation. Although the doctor was cleared of all charges, when one enters his name into Google the charges still appear on the first page of results. Russo filed a case against Google in Spanish courts.</Annotation> The problem came to the attention of the European Union, as evidenced by the famous words of the Commissioner for Justice: “God forgives and forgets, but the web never <Annotation target="does.”">This phrase, much cited in the press, was uttered by Viviane Reding, a journalist and politician from Luxembourg, and the EU Commissioner for Justice and Fundamental Rights.</Annotation>

<br />

A second important problem is guaranteeing access to all public documents created by the state. This could be an application to a given office pertaining to, for instance, the birth of a child, the sale of property, tax issues, etc. Thinking optimistically, it would seem that if the document was entered into the public sphere, it should be accessible to others. Let us remember, however, that much of the information contained in such documents could be considered sensitive information, and we may not necessarily want our neighbor, for instance, to know exactly what we do or buy. Certainly, we would probably prefer to tell him ourselves rather than allow him to find out from the Internet. The next issue is encompassed by the question of to what extent should an author’s rights be protected. On the one hand, such regulations formalize activities in the digital realm and are an incredibly important factor in the development of intellectual capital. On the other hand, on the web, the predominant opinion is that such laws hamper the development of open archives and obstruct the free flow of information. One even sees demands for open access, which are supported by the view that author’s rights are formulated in an archaic way that does not correspond to the realities of a digital world.

<br />

Yet another issue, with particularly meaningful practical implications, is the question of whether it is permissible to photograph public spaces without restrictions. Formerly it had not even occurred to anyone to ask this question. In Communist Poland, many offices had signs saying “Photography Forbidden.” Such bans, generally pertaining to objects of strategic importance to the State, originated in the period of the First World War, the time of Soldier Svejk, and were generally met with glee. In a democratic country, nobody bothered with these laws until the possibility of a massive body of digital photographs being published and rendered searchable arose. Multiple firms undertook the project of mapping public spaces with the help of photography, which led to many unforeseen problems (theoretically, in the public sphere we have freedom of action, but in fact…).

<br />

And finally, one last question: should users of social portals be protected? For many reasons, operators of such portals answer with a resounding “No”, and users feel increasingly anxious (though not so much so as to endanger the spread of popular services).

<br />

These are only a few of the questions that have arisen recently. It is impossible to discuss all of the important problems, but it does seem that one can bring them into an essential opposition; the opposition of an unquestionably encroaching process of digital archiving, or a digital transformation of information. It is tied to broader social trends that we are currently encountering. On the one hand, we want to be open, on the other – we’d rather protect our privacy; we depend on an unlimited access to information, but we demand the protection of intellectual property; we want access to all accumulated data (or rather the possibility of access and free use of all data), but we demand a simple way to search it: we are incredibly irritated when Google is unable to deliver and instantaneous accurate result for our search. In conclusion, we want all the comforts of digital life with none of the costs. These problems extend beyond the jurisdiction of archiving: these are social problems, exceeding, in large measure, the intellectual horizons of post-modernity. It is characterized by an unprecedented dualism: on the one hand we find the rise of a whole realm of social activities that didn’t exist in the Industrial Age, on the other, there remain certain solutions or institutions from the modern age. A good example is the problem of author’s rights in the digital sphere. Nobody has thought of a formula that would simultaneously respect all rights of the author and guarantee open access to protected contents (open access means not so much free access, but rather the possibility of searching through documents and retrieving information).

<br />

I believe that practical solutions to the above problems must be found in the next decade (or at most two), because otherwise they will severely hamper the activities of both public and commercial institutions, demanding solutions with increasing urgency. Perhaps this will lead to a breakthrough in society, or more meaningful socio-political changes, and as a consequence – will mark postmodernity as the age that bridged the old and the new.
